You might suffer from a damaged pulp that can undermine your oral health. Your dentist will probably recommend root canal therapy to prevent the spread of infection. A root canal procedure will save you money in the long run and bring many oral health benefits.

Root canal treatment offers several benefits, from relieving dental pain to enhanced tooth protection. In many cases, a root canal treatment can last a lifetime with proper care. That\'s why we have enlisted some notable benefits of root canal therapy for your enlightenment. Let\'s get to know these.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":1} -->\n<ol start="1"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Root Canal Therapy Helps Relieve Symptoms of Infection</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people with infected root canals suffer from fever, jaw pain, mouth tenderness, and swelling. A root canal procedure helps relieve such symptoms and comfort the patients.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, patients have high sensitivity to hot and cold foods and cannot eat them properly. With a mal nutritious diet, they can have certain deficiencies which can undermine their health. Root canal therapy helps boost overall health and relieve the symptoms and progression of infection.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->\n<ol start="2"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>RCT Alleviates Dental Pain and Discomfort</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A throbbing toothache is challenging to handle and tolerate. It can devastate your productivity, and you can have sleep problems. An infected root canal causes toothache that ranges from mild to severe. The pain may be consistent or come and go, but it can distract you from work. A root canal procedure can help alleviate this dental pain by removing the infected pulp.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A root canal cleanses the bacteria and the damaged nerves and soothes your toothache. Many sedation options are available to remove the infected pulp without exaggerating dental anxiety. The root canal procedure is virtually painless and helps restore your productivity.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5896,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/700.jpg" alt="Benefits of Root Canal Therapy" class="wp-image-5896"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->\n<ol start="3"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Prevents Tooth Loss</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another significant advantage of root canal therapy is that it prevents tooth loss. Tooth loss can also happen when the tooth has a cavity and is severely decayed. If the infection is left untreated, the tooth is at significant risk of being extracted. Sometimes, the tooth becomes weak and loosened so that it may fall independently.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, a root canal procedure helps prevent tooth loss by removing the infected pulp. When the infection is removed, the surrounding teeth are also well protected. Moreover, the root canal procedure helps prevent teeth from shifting, and patients can regain oral health.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} -->\n<ol start="4"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Stops the Spread of Infection</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The infected pulp is the leading cause of decay in the tooth cavity. When the bacteria accumulate, the pulp infection comes out, and it can even spread to other areas. In doing so, the infected pulp in just a single tooth can affect the adjacent teeth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A root canal procedure is necessary to address such an issue. The root canal helps preserve the adjacent teeth and stops the spread of disease. Otherwise, the infection spreads to other regions, and the patient has to undergo other dental procedures.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":5} -->\n<ol start="5"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Root Canal Therapy Provides Visually Appealing Results</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dentist will likely crown your tooth during root canal therapy for protection. It will help preserve your smile, and you\'ll have good self-esteem. Besides this, it will enhance tooth aesthetics and make your tooth look better.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the affected area is cleansed correctly, the cavity is filled with a polymer material, or a crown is placed. Crowns help to protect the affected tooth after a root canal and are known for their cosmetic appeal, too. They match your tooth\'s color and give you a natural-looking smile.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":6} -->\n<ol start="6"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>It Enhances the Chewing Function</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5895,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/699.jpg" alt="Benefits of Root Canal Therapy" class="wp-image-5895"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An infected pulp causes pain and swelling that makes chewing uncomfortable. With a lack of chewing capability, you cannot eat your favorite foods because it hurts. Root canal therapy enhances chewing function by eliminating temperate sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you have hot or cold sensitivity, your chewing becomes quite painful. Besides this, it also refrains you from eating normally, and you can have several nutritional deficiencies. A root canal is necessary to eliminate these painful experiences so you can enjoy your favorite foods again.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":7} -->\n<ol start="7"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Prevents Jawbone Degeneration</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can preserve your tooth and the jawbone by saving your tooth through a root canal. Unlike tooth extraction, a root canal procedure leaves the infected tooth intact. This procedure provides adequate stimulation to the jawbone and prevents its degeneration. On the other hand, if a tooth has been lost or extracted, it creates a gap where adjacent teeth can shift. These teeth shifting cause overcrowding, and the patient\'s jawbone degenerates.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The root canal saves the tooth\'s structure and helps preserve the jawbone. It is an excellent alternative to tooth extraction, where you can save a tooth. That is why you should readily visit your dentist if you have infected pulp symptoms.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":8} -->\n<ol start="8"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>This Treatment is Virtually Pain-Free</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Root canal treatment is pain-free and less painful than a tooth extraction. The recovery time and person\'s healing are relatively easy before he can return to his routine. Patients who experience a root canal describe it as six times less painful than a tooth extraction procedure. Modern equipment, innovative techniques, and adequate anesthesia have made it straightforward.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Root canal therapy is both efficient and cost-effective. It just requires one to two dental sittings to complete the procedure. Many people can afford this treatment as it is highly budget-friendly&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, it saves money in the long run if the infection is treated well on time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":9} -->\n<ol start="9"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>It Helps Preserve Your Natural Smile</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A root canal procedure aims at saving a tooth and not replacing it. Many options exist to replace a tooth; nevertheless, they never behave as your natural teeth do. A root canal is your best option to preserve your smile and continue enjoying your favorite foods.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nothing can ever look, feel, or function like your natural teeth. That is why dentists highly recommend root canal procedures throughout the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":10} -->\n<ol start="10"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Root Canal Therapy Boosts Your Overall Health</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides giving oral health benefits, a root canal boosts your overall health. It helps prevent severe infections and certain health complications. An infected pulp, when left untreated, may cause health problems other than oral health.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, the pulp infection can spread to other body parts such as the jaw, brain, or sinuses.

It\'s good to be well-informed before getting the actual procedure done. Let\'s discuss things about Invisalign that you should know as a patient or if you plan to avail of the treatment.

It is a form of braces that uses clear, nearly invisible aligner trays to rectify problems such as underbite, overbite, crooked, and teeth crowding.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Invisalign has a high success rate of over 95%. Recent estimates reveal that almost 20% of the global population suffers from bite problems. Clear aligners help correct this problem by readjusting the jaw position. Currently, over eight million people across the globe are wearing clear aligners or Invisalign. The good thing about Invisalign is that it can serve people of any age. Patients up to 80 years of age can wear them, and they are practically invisible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Invisalign offers great convenience where patients do not need to visit the dentist repeatedly.

They are nearly invisible, and the clear aligner trays will hide your ongoing dental treatment.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Unlike traditional braces, Invisalign looks better and decreases pain and discomfort, especially while eating.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Invisalign is safe for all age groups, including adults, children, and adolescents. However, it is recommended for children only when they reach over 13.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Invisalign helps correct various dental problems of a mild to moderate nature. These include crossbite, underbite, overbite, misalignment, crowded or crooked teeth, overjet, and teeth gap.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Sometimes, people want to avoid wearing aligners on special occasions. Removing your aligners for a few hours is never a problem; your treatment can stay on track.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Things to Remember About Invisalign&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Invisalign has helped millions of people in attaining a beautiful smile. It has improved their psychological well-being and boosted their self-confidence. If you are considering Invisalign treatment, here are a few things to remember before the procedure.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Invisalign treatment will take about six months to a year. However, you\'ll start noticing the results within a few weeks. The Invisalign aligners need to be changed after every two weeks. Once worn for about two weeks each, they are swapped for a new pair. Along with these, your dentist will check the progression of your treatment.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You must be responsible for wearing the aligners. You must wear Invisalign for about 20-22 hours a day. Otherwise, they won\'t be effective in fixing your dental issues.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you are a smoker, then you need to stop it. Smoking will stain your aligners, and it impairs the natural healing process. Moreover, your treatment will last longer, affecting your oral health.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Water is the best drink when you are wearing the aligners. Any other liquid refreshment, such as coffee or a colored beverage, will stain your aligners, and they\'ll look dirty. If you are a coffee lover and want it at any rate, then remove your aligners while having it. Then, brush your teeth immediately and rinse your mouth accordingly. Now, wear your aligners again.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>An average Invisalign wearer has to undergo 18-30 aligners approximately. Each set of aligners has to be worn for about two weeks. So, from start to finish, you would change multiple aligners.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Invisalign isn\'t right for everyone, and knowing if you are a suitable candidate is essential. Traditional braces suit you if you have severe dental issues such as extreme teeth misalignment. Similarly, treatment other than Invisalign is well-suited if you have significant bite issues. Get yourself evaluated to know if Invisalign is the right choice for you.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5887,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/666a.jpg" alt="Invisalign Guide: Everything You Should Know" class="wp-image-5887"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How Invisalign is Better Than Metal Braces?&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, many people prefer Invisalign as compared to traditional braces. The reasons are numerous; for instance, they are practically invisible. They are super comfortable, and you do not have any food restrictions. Invisalign aligners are easy to remove and can be cleaned with much ease.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though Invisalign is nearly invisible, you can see them if you look closely. However, they are barely noticeable and help elevate your confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Is Invisalign Appropriate for You?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are an adult or in your teens and want a radiant smile, then Invisalign is a good option. However, your dentist can better evaluate you if you are a potential candidate for it.

As an ideal candidate for Invisalign, you must meet the following set of characteristics:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You can adhere to the Invisalign guidelines and is self-disciplined to follow the dentist\'s instructions.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You can wear the Invisalign aligners for an extended period and remove them while eating.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You have mild to moderate dental issues that need to be fixed with Invisalign, such as minor misalignment or crooked teeth.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You do not have severe dental issues which need advanced orthodontic treatment.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How Does Invisalign Work?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Invisalign uses a controlled force to move teeth in their desired position. It uses a series of clear aligners (unlike brackets and wires) that help straighten the teeth. Invisalign uses gentle pressure to move the misaligned teeth into their correct position along the periodontal membrane.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Invisalign procedure is divided into four steps which are enlisted below.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Initial Consultation: The dentist sees if you are a potential candidate for Invisalign. Only some people are suitable candidates; an evaluation must be made at this initial step.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Customized Treatment Plan: After your dentist approves that you are a suitable candidate, a customized treatment plan is made accordingly.

Your dentist will also guide you on wearing the aligners, and you must follow the instructions seriously. Most patients need to switch over to new trays after every two weeks.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Dental Visits: While you wear your aligners, you have to visit your dentist after every six weeks. Your dentist will monitor your progress by assessing your dental health. It will help prevent decay and maintain adequate oral hygiene during treatment. At this step, you may also need professional cleaning to remove plaque or tartar from your teeth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Does Invisalign Hurt?

However, you can still expect slight gum soreness when changing your aligners. Invisalign treatment has no food restrictions, and you can enjoy your favorite foods. However, removing your aligners before you eat is best so that no food gets stuck in your braces.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, a new set of aligners are challenging to remove, and the process can be painful. You can eat your food without removing the aligners with your dentist\'s permission. If some food particles stick to your Invisalign, there is nothing to worry about.

If you follow your dentist\'s advice, your Invisalign treatment will eventually succeed.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Clean your trays to ensure healthy results. The Invisalign trays are exposed to bacteria and other harmful substances; therefore, you must adequately clean them. Also, do not return an old tray if damaged, stolen, or lost.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are missing a tooth, it\u2019s imperative to fill the gap. Otherwise, the surrounding teeth will shift and will cause further dental problems. Besides causing dental issues, your facial shape will change, impacting your smile. According to estimates, around 178 million Americans are missing at least one tooth. Tooth loss is widespread, where 69% of the global population has at least one missing tooth by the age they reach 35. Dental crowns and bridges provide convenient ways to fix your missing teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, there are many dental methods to improve the smile and aid in the chewing process. However, dental crowns and bridges have remained the safe and preferred choices for decades. You might wonder which one to consider for your missing tooth replacement. Here, we\u2019ll discuss the details of crowns and bridges, along with their differences, for your general understanding.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->\n<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>\u201cDental bridges and crowns have an average success rate of over 95%. They both can last for several decades with the right dental care\u201d.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What Is a Dental Crown and Why It\u2019s Needed?\u00a0</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A dental crown is placed on the top of a damaged tooth like a tooth-shaped cap. The purpose of a crown is to restore the tooth\u2019s function, strength, size, shape, and appearance. It helps protect the tooth against bacteria and other harmful irritants in the mouth. Since the crown fully encases the tooth; so, the food particles, saliva, bacteria, and acids cannot reach it. These irritants usually cause most dental problems in the mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are numerous types of crowns available today. Your dentist recommends the right type that matches your dental health and affordability range. Sometimes, it\u2019s up to the patient\u2019s willingness to the kind of crown they want to wear. Some of the types of crowns are:\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Stainless Steel Crown</strong>: It is mainly employed when the patient has to wear a temporary crown. A temporary crown is fitted primarily in the mouth before a permanent one arrives. A stainless-steel crown protects the tooth against bacteria until the permanent crown is placed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Metal Crown:</strong> The metal or titanium crown is durable and incredibly strong. A metal crown has great resistance against decay and easily withstands biting and chewing forces. It\u2019s a durable option and more expensive than other types.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Porcelain Crown</strong>: Porcelain is the best material that mimics the natural tooth. It is well-suited for patients needing a crown in a front damaged tooth. It is quite popular in restorative and cosmetic dentistry, providing a natural look.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Hybrid Crown</strong>: The hybrid crown blends metal (titanium) and porcelain. It is a durable crown that mimics the natural tooth. It is ideal for people who want to consider durability along with aesthetics.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, getting a dental filling is all you need to restore the tooth\u2019s function. Generally, a dental filling is used to repair a small portion of the damaged tooth. In contrast, a dental crown protects the tooth entirely when a dental filling can\u2019t repair it. A dental crown is most suited in the following situations:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Failed dental filling</strong>: Sometimes, a dental filling comes loose because of recurring decay. The filling breaks, so you need a dental crown to protect your tooth\u2019s structure.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Multiple or Large Cavities</strong>: Large cavities compromise the tooth\u2019s structure. That\u2019s why many dentists use crowns to enable the tooth\u2019s function. Preparing for a tooth filling might fail.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>After Root Canal Procedure</strong>: A root canal procedure is usually suggested when you have severely decayed teeth. After the infected pulp is removed, it is sealed afterward. The sealant is mainly covered with a crown to provide strength and durability to the tooth.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Fractured Tooth</strong>: A fractured tooth refers to a broken, chipped, or cracked tooth. It usually results due to an injury, trauma, or accident. The fillings may fix minor cracks; however, a dental crown is a better option for providing added protection.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Discolored or Weak Enamel</strong>: Sometimes, the tooth\u2019s enamel is weakened or discolored. A tooth with weak enamel is more prone to cavities and decay. Crown placement keeps such a tooth healthy.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Multiple Fillings</strong>: A crown is better if you have multiple amalgam fillings in the mouth. More than eight amalgam fillings increase mercury in the blood and cause serious health issues, such as neurological disorders.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What Is a Dental Bridge and What Are Its Functions?&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A tooth bridge is a false tooth that permanently replaces a missing tooth. With one or more missing teeth, a dental bridge can help fill the gap. A dental bridge can last up to several decades with the right care. Replacing a missing tooth is essential to fill the gap. Your teeth work together and having one or more missing teeth cause problems. If a tooth is missing, the surrounding teeth move into the space to cause problems. These include chewing difficulties, bite issues, and pain from extra stress on the jaw and teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5882,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/516a.jpg" alt="What Are Dental Crowns and Bridges?" class="wp-image-5882"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A dental bridge fixes such problems and aids in chewing and speaking ability. Besides providing better aesthetics, it also restores your smile and dental health. A typical dental bridge comprises abutment teeth and a false tooth (pontics). The anchoring or abutment teeth in a dental bridge could be your natural teeth or dental implants. The four main types of dental bridges include the following.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Traditional Bridge</strong>: Traditional bridge is the most common type; it has two or more crowns and a false tooth. It is usually made of ceramics, porcelain, or metal.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Cantilever Bridge</strong>: The cantilever bridge connects the false tooth to only one abutment tooth. It suits people with teeth on only one side of the gap.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Resin-bonded Bridge</strong>: The resin-bonded bridge is also known as Maryland dental bridge. This type is mainly employed when patients have missing teeth at the front.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Implant-Supported Bridge</strong>: This bridge is similar to the traditional type except that it is held in place by the implants.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, dental bridge is available in different types, and your oral health professional is the right person to suggest to you. Sometimes, dental implants are unsuitable for patients with one or more missing teeth. It could be due to affordability, bone defect, or your busy work schedule. Here we will discuss when you need a tooth bridge compared to dental implants.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>You Want a Fast Treatment</strong>. Sometimes, a person is a qualifying candidate for dental implants. A dental bridge is suitable if you want a fast treatment to replace missing teeth. But, its procedure could be more time-consuming. It usually takes about six months to place the implants. In contrast, bridges take about three weeks (maximum) to replace the missing teeth.\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>There Is an Underlying Bone Defect</strong>. The success rate of a dental implant heavily depends upon bone density. If there is an underlying bone defect, you will require another procedure known as a \u201cbone graft.\u201d On the other hand, a dental bridge can even be fitted with a bone defect and replaces the missing teeth.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>You Have Budget Issues</strong>. Dental implants are quite costly, and not everyone can afford these. A dental bridge is a cost-effective way to replace your missing tooth.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Your Teeth Are Missing for So Long</strong>. When the teeth are missing for so long, the dentist has to employ braces to fit the implants. Also, the surrounding teeth have tilted in the open space because of the gap. A dental bridge reshapes those tilted teeth and replaces the missing ones.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>You Have 3-4 Missing Teeth in a Row</strong>. A dental bridge is most suited to patients who have 3-4 missing teeth in a row. It restores the chewing and speaking capability within a short time.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Similarities and Differences Between a Dental Crown Bridge&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental crowns and bridges have many similarities in function and aesthetics. Both of these aid in the chewing process and make it easier to talk. They provide a hassle-free way to take care of them and are super easy to maintain. Placing a crown or dental bridge helps restore your smile and makes you feel more confident. They usually last more than a decade with the proper oral hygiene routine.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides many similarities, there are some differences as well. First, a crown is used to protect the damaged tooth. The crown acts like a covering to provide strength and durability to the tooth. A dental bridge helps fill the gap created due to one or more missing teeth. It comprises two crowns with a false tooth in the middle to fill the void. Second, your dentist can fit a crown on the same day if his office provides this facility. Otherwise, you may require at least two dental visits for crown placement. In contrast, a dental bridge usually takes three weeks to complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental crowns and bridges provide a cost-effective way to restore decayed or missing teeth. A crown is best if the tooth is still functional but decayed. However, a dental bridge is the best choice if a tooth is beyond repair or needs to be extracted. If you have missing or decayed teeth, visit your dentist soon for optimal oral health.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS, at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>\u00a0to learn more about dental crowns and bridges.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Resource:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-dental-bridges/">What are the different types of Dental Bridges?</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>*This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The health of your family is at number one priority. You, as a parent, strive to ensure that your family is super healthy and attains a good quality of life. Besides other health concerns, dental health is also essential to achieve good well-being. Good well-being comes from consuming a nutritious diet, exercising, maintaining healthy oral habits, leading a good life, and protecting oneself from diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Countless bacteria live inside our mouths, and maintaining good oral hygiene is imperative to defeat them. Many bacteria can cause gum disease, tooth decay, bad breath, and other problems. As a parent, you must understand healthy oral habits to protect your family\'s dental health. Also, you can encourage your family members to adopt the correct oral practices for a healthy smile. Here we have enlisted some practical tips to say goodbye to harmful bacteria by focusing on healthy oral habits. So, let\'s get started.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Make A Dental Calendar for Your Family as A Reminder&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A dental calendar will help you enlist your family\'s daily dental health requirements. Make a dental calendar for your family that will remind them of their daily tasks. You can consult an oral health specialist in this regard to discuss oral health needs for optimal health. Guide your family in that manner, especially your children and the elderly. Then, ask your family members to check off their daily oral health responsibilities. Besides many other benefits, it will have two main advantages. First, your family will take care of their oral health needs. Second, they would keep an eye on other family members and compare their checklists with theirs. It will make them aware of what others are doing and what they need to improve.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Replace Old Toothbrushes and Toothpaste with Something New&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Children must be taught with fun and creative ideas. They like to adopt things in that way. Ensure that your family uses their toothbrush for only 2-3 months. After that, it\'s essential to change it to avoid oral health illnesses. If an old toothbrush is kept for so long, it is less effective at cleaning plaque. Besides causing tooth discoloration, plaque is responsible for many other problems, such as gingivitis, periodontal disease, tooth decay, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5874,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/486a.jpg" alt="Healthy Oral Habits for the Whole Family" class="wp-image-5874"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During your next shopping trip, let your children pick their toothbrushes and toothpaste. Let them pick their favorite-colored toothbrushes and toothpaste. However, ensure that they choose from the kids\' section and that the toothpaste has fluoride.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Let Your Family Master the Art of Brushing and Flossing&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Experts say brushing your teeth at least twice a day is essential. Flossing must also be done regularly. Brushing and flossing seem easy; however, they must practice them correctly. Otherwise, it won\'t clean the plaque from and inside the gum line. Teach your family the proper technique for brushing and flossing. Here\'s what we have for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Brushing technique</strong>: Use a soft-bristled brush and keep a fluoride toothpaste. Keep a circular motion, then scrub the teeth\' back, front, and chewing surfaces. Do this for about 2-3 minutes; afterward, brush your tongue and roof. Now rinse and spit.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Flossing technique</strong>: Flossing should be done at least once a day, and the most suitable time is in the evening. Take a floss pick or a string of floss. Run it down on one side and then up the other. Ensure that you go entirely down the gum line. It will help eliminate plaque attaching to each tooth\'s surface. When your floss gets dirty, it\'s time to switch off.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->\n<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>\u201cIf you don\'t brush and floss, you will likely give your dentist a big tip\u201d.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Use Mouthwash for Added Protection&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A mouthwash helps reduce bacteria in your mouth and gives added protection against it. Also, it increases the chances of cleanliness against plaque, besides brushing and flossing. Regular use of antimicrobial mouthwash helps prevent gum disease and cavity formation.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Visit a family dentist near you to know which mouthwash is best for your family. Also, teach your children about using mouthwash before buying it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Ensure That Your Family Is Getting the Right Amount of Fluoride&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fluoride is a natural mineral that contributes to healthy tooth enamel. It fights harmful bacteria and cavities and helps repair the damage caused by these acids. This process is known as remineralization, commonly known as the "tooth repair process." During remineralization, the weakened tooth enamel is strengthened, and the lost minerals are restored to optimal oral health.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, many communities have fluoridated water to reduce the prevalence of cavities. If your community doesn\'t have fluoridated water, you can have other sources of fluoride. For instance, fluoride toothpaste, dental products such as mouthwash, and certain fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ensure that your family gets the right fluoride content as per their age. It is imperative to consult a dentist who might refer to fluoride treatment for your children.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Keep A Family Dentist and Have Regular Dental Checkups&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Keep a family dentist who lives nearby. Make a visit with your family to the dentist at least twice a year. Ensure that you take your children after every 3-4 months. Children are more fond of eating sugary and starchy foods, which increases the likelihood of cavities. Consistent dental visits will reduce the prevalence of holes or pits, and they can practice many preventative measures to maintain good oral health.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even if the elders in your family wear complete dentures, it\'s still essential to visit the dentist. It will help identify potential problems even before they occur. Tooth decay and gum disease, if treated well on time, reduce future oral health problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Ask Everyone to Quit Bad Habits That Undermine Oral Health&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Smoking is a significant cause of gum disease in the United States and causes severe tooth discoloration. Also, it affects the soft tissue of the teeth, causing problems such as tartar or plaque buildup. Habits such as smoking and using tobacco severely undermine the health of the teeth and gums. Therefore, it\'s essential to quit them to enjoy better health. Moreover, beverages such as tea and coffee can also cause teeth staining. Stained teeth disrupt the quality of a smile, and then your family will have to consider treatment options such as teeth whitening.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides bearing additional costs, such habits are also harmful to general health. For instance, smoking can lead to lung cancer, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, diabetes, and so. Teach your children about the effects of smoking and too much caffeine beforehand. It will not only help maintain good oral hygiene but will also save them from many physical illnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Eat Healthily and Limit Sugary and Acidic Foods&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5875,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/488a.jpg" alt="Healthy Oral Habits for the Whole Family" class="wp-image-5875"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eating a well-balanced and nutritious diet is good for overall health.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are replacement tooth roots that substitute for missing teeth. They are artificial tooth roots that can replace one or multiple missing teeth. Made of titanium, dental implants function like natural teeth and are super easy to clean. Dental implants have numerous benefits, which is why they are becoming quite popular worldwide. Dental implant treatment has a high success rate, adding more to psychological well-being. Explore more benefits of dental implants and consider choosing them for your missing teeth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to the <em>Journal of Oral Implantology</em>, Dental implants are effective up to 98% of the time, whereas crowns only survive between 50% and 80% for ten years.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite advancements in dental care, many Americans suffer tooth loss for various reasons. These include severe tooth decay, dental injury, trauma, or periodontal disease. Recent statistics show that around 178 million Americans have at least one missing tooth. Moreover, approximately 40 million Americans are missing all of their teeth. Missing teeth cause poor jaw function and impair chewing and speaking ability. It also affects the adjacent teeth to shift and create bite irregularities. For lost and damaged teeth, you can have several options for restoration. Dental implants are one such option that stands out from the rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What Are Dental Implants?&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A dental implant is an artificial structure inserted into the patient\'s jawbone. It acts as an anchor for the artificial tooth, known as a "crown." The crown is custom-made to fit adequately in the patient\'s mouth. The artificial tooth is connected to the implant by an "abutment."\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are usually available in two forms, i.e., endosteal and subperiosteal. The former is more common and is placed in the bone. The latter is slightly different and is placed on the bone. These implants are known as root implants and are fused directly to the jawbone. Rather than drilling now in the jawbone, the dentist will prepare below the patient\'s gumline. Afterward, a metal frame is installed over the top of the bone. And after gum healing, the artificial tooth root is installed.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people have missing or decayed teeth but do not qualify for the standard criteria for implanting artificial tooth roots. Therefore, before discussing it with your dentist, knowing if you are a candidate for implants is essential. So, let\'s explore the requirements for dental implants.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Healthy Gums</strong> - The patient\'s gums should be healthy and free from gum disease. The oral health professional will closely work with the gums throughout the procedure.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Adequate Bone Density -</strong> The bone density should be sufficient to support and protect the implants. Otherwise, the dentist would utilize the "bone grafting" method before installing the implants.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Good Oral Health and Hygiene</strong> - The patient\'s oral health should be in good condition to minimize complications during or after the procedure.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Minimal Bruxism</strong> - A patient with usual teeth grinding or clenching would exert too much pressure on the implants. It will risk the implants, and they\'ll end up as a failed procedure.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Non-Tobacco Users</strong> - Those who use tobacco won\'t be good candidates for dental implants. Tobacco and smoking prevent healing in the mouth and decrease the success rate of implants.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5866,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/459a.jpg" alt="Benefits of Dental Implants" class="wp-image-5866"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Remarkable Benefits of Dental Implants&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dentists place more than 5 million dental implants every year in America alone. It shows dental implants are famous and have many benefits. Besides improving the bite force and correcting the problem of missing teeth, dental implants provide both personal and psychological benefits. Here we will discuss the most dominant and unique benefits of dental implants for your enlightenment. So, let\'s get started.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Prevents Jawbone Loss</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When there is no tooth, the space causes the jawbone to deteriorate. The missing tooth, left untreated, further affects the jawbone density, continuing over the years. When the missing tooth isn\'t replaced in the first year, the jawbone decreases to at least 25% of its volume.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people choose dentures to replace their missing teeth. However, it is also a valid option to fill the space. But dentures often become loose and, in a way, could accelerate bone loss. Dental implants are best to stimulate natural bone growth and help prevent bone loss.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Restores Bite Force</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are super comfortable and help restore the bite force. The implants are made of titanium which is a biocompatible material. This titanium alloy provides excellent strength and support to the artificial tooth root. As a result, the person can eat normally and exert the biting force without worry. This biting force provided by implants is almost the same as that of natural teeth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other tooth replacement options, such as dentures, do not restore nearly the same amount of the bite force. They aren\'t anchored in a place like the implants, which provide a strong foundation. Moreover, options like dentures mostly sit on the top of the gums and need to be anchored better. Dental implants are appropriately anchored in the jawbone and facilitate the biting force and chewing capability.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Enables Chewing and Speaking Power</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5867,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/457a.jpg" alt="Benefits of Dental Implants" class="wp-image-5867"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People with missing teeth have difficulty chewing, impairing their natural speech. If they are missing a few molars, they cannot eat well and are deprived of enjoying their favorite foods. Implants fill the gap created due to missing teeth and make it easier to eat again.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Teeth play an essential role in speaking; missing teeth at the front can impair natural speech. It can be embarrassing and distracting, especially in a public space. Dental implants fix such issues and make it easier to speak with confidence. Implants provide a surface for the tongue to press again while forming words and prevent them from slipping around in the mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Supports Adjacent Teeth</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The gap created because of a missing tooth causes teeth shifting. These teeth shifting can cause the teeth (on either side of the opening) to move and result in teeth misalignment. Misaligned teeth create cosmetic flaws, are harder to clean, and cause you to chew improperly. Moreover, they increase the likelihood of cavities, tooth decay, or gum disease.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants support the adjacent teeth and fill the gap of a missing tooth. So, it prevents teeth shifting and eliminates the chances of teeth misalignment. Dental implants help you maintain a brighter and even smile and elevate your confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Powerful and Permanent Restoration</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are highly durable and offer a permanent restoration for missing teeth. However, dental implants usually last for a lifetime if proper dental hygiene is maintained. Other tooth replacement options mostly need repairing or a periodic replacement with time. Though, you may require replacing the crown on your implant after 15 years.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The implants efficiently integrate with the jawbone and are a powerful tooth replacement option. Implants are designed to fuse with the jawbone, so they are permanent and mimic the natural tooth function.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Prevents Facial Sagging</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Teeth support the facial structure; when you have missing teeth, you lose that support, and it could result in facial sagging. As a result, it changes your face\'s shape. These changes include excess wrinkles around the mouth, a more pointed chin, thinning lips, and so on. Because of these changes, you may look older than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Facial sagging happens because of inadequate bone density that results from missing teeth. Dental implants prevent facial sagging and help maintain the shape of your face. As a result, you enjoy good oral health along with psychological well-being.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Concluding Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are super easy to clean and behave just like natural teeth. They are designed to offer a permanent solution to tooth loss and can even last for an entire lifetime. Besides supporting adjacent teeth, dental implants help prevent tooth cavities. If you have missing teeth and want dental implants, be ready to visit your dentist.

This could be due to bacteria that enter the pulp or because of a tooth injury. When the pulp inflammation isn\'t treated, it can cause severe dental pain or sometimes lead to an abscess (a painful collection of pus).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>When Do You Need Root Canal Treatment? Signs and Symptoms\u00a0</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A study revealed that root canal symptoms differ as per the bacterial infection.

Your tooth might have a grayish-black appearance because of damaged roots. Tooth discoloration can also be there for other reasons, but it\'s always better to see your dentist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Swollen Gums or Having a Gum Boil</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Swollen gums near the infected tooth are also one of the warning signs of requiring a root canal. It can give you an unpleasant taste in the mouth or affect the quality of your breath. Swelling could come and go, but it stays there. Moreover, the gums might also become tender, especially when you touch them. At times, you might have gum boiled or, more specifically, a pimple on your gum.

It\'s because bacteria reach it and the nerves around the tooth might also become damaged. The nerves of the tooth may become damaged, and they may cause severe dental pain and tooth sensitivity. So, <strong>root canal therapy</strong> might be required. Even if your tooth hasn\'t chipped or cracked after an accident or an injury, you must visit the dentist.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Swollen Jaw</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, your jaw becomes visibly swollen.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental trauma or an accident might occur, and it can severely disrupt a person\'s teeth functioning. Besides having a bad teeth appearance, it can also result in lower self-esteem. Moreover, it can also cause severe dental pain accompanied by other symptoms. A cosmetic dentist can recommend full mouth reconstruction to help restore oral health and attain confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You probably have significant teeth damage if you have experienced dental trauma. When damaged teeth are left untreated, they create further complications. You must be willing to visit the dentist for a quick restoration. Let\'s explore what full mouth reconstruction is and the steps involved in this procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What is Full Mouth Reconstruction (FMR)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A cosmetic full mouth reconstruction is a procedure that aims at restoring a person\'s dental health. This holistic treatment is all you need for unhealthy gums, missing teeth, and other complications. FMR is an ideal treatment for people with multiple missing teeth, broken teeth, severe tooth decay, and large cavities. However, it\'s best to evaluate yourself if you are a candidate for this treatment. Usually, it is good to consider the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Severe Gum Disease</strong>. If you are suffering from advanced gum disease, it increases the chance of getting serious health complications. These include teeth loss, oral infections, systemic health conditions, etc. A cosmetic full mouth reconstruction will help ensure the health of your teeth and gums. Also, it will improve the appearance of your mouth.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Excessively Worn Teeth</strong>. Our teeth wear down with age, and this is entirely normal. However, excessively worn teeth can lead to pulp infection, a misaligned bite, and other serious issues. A full mouth rehabilitation may include root canals, crown placements, dental tooth extractions, and replacements.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Accident or Trauma</strong>. You might need a full mouth reconstruction if you have experienced an accident, trauma, or sports injury. Dental trauma can leave you with damage to your teeth, and a full mouth rehabilitation can correct your situation.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Chronic or Jaw Pain</strong>. This treatment might be best for you if you have certain types of chronic pain. You might be suffering from Temporomandibular disorders, have jaw soreness, or have pain in the muscles. Why not visit your dentist to elevate your state and say goodbye to these chronic pains?&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5854,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/208a.jpg" alt="Procedural Steps Involved in a Cosmetic Full Mouth Reconstruction" class="wp-image-5854"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>How Long Will It Take for Restoration?&nbsp;</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The length of the procedure might take one entire month or even more. It depends on the specific needs of the patient. However, in most cases, a full mouth reconstruction usually requires several procedures to be carried out. So they might take a bit longer than other dental treatments.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Steps Involved in FMR:&nbsp;</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each patient\'s need is different. Some might need a full mouth reconstruction because of an accident or trauma. Others need it because of an underlying medical condition or otherwise. Some of the usual steps involved in this procedure include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Initial Consultation</strong>. At first, the patient has to undergo an initial consultation with a cosmetic dentist. The dentist will discuss the treatment\'s primary goals and other concerns here. Also, he would take the patient\'s entire medical history and resolve the patient\'s query.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Records and Impressions</strong>. At this step, the impressions of the patient\'s teeth are taken and recorded. Further, they are analyzed to create the treatment plan per the patient\'s oral health needs.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>3D Printing</strong>. The dentist will create a digital design and a 3D model of dental restorations here. The patient will also test the mockup restorations before final adjustments.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>. The dentist will make a treatment plan to facilitate the patient\'s oral health. The dentist will create a treatment plan using the patient\'s previous visual examination results. It can include procedures like corrective jaw surgery, removal of certain teeth, placing implants, root canal therapy, and so on.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Treatment</strong>. A full mouth reconstruction involves multiple sittings at the dentist and is carried out in different stages.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A full mouth reconstruction is one of the most complex procedures in modern dentistry. However, due to advanced techniques, the success rate is much higher. Knowing about a cosmetic full mouth reconstruction is essential to facilitate yourself and your significant others. It\'s always better to deal with an issue proactively and be well-informed on time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>,\u00a0to learn more about the Procedural Steps Involved in a Cosmetic Full Mouth Reconstruction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/what-is-cosmetic-dentistry/">What is Cosmetic Dentistry?</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It may seem needless or uncomfortable if you\'ve never had a tooth extracted. The dentist will discuss the tooth extraction procedure with you beforehand and make sure your appointment is as peaceful, quick, and painless as possible. To remove a tooth, a dentist or oral surgeon uses either local, general, intravenous, or a mix of these for short, painless outpatient treatment. Extraction of visible teeth is routine. Procedures involving impacted, fractured, or otherwise compromised teeth are more complex.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Reasons for Tooth Extraction</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While wisdom teeth extraction is common among teenagers and some adults, there are other instances where an adult might need a tooth out. Fillings, crowns, and other dental work can often restore teeth that have been fractured or decayed. However, there are some times when the damage is too significant, and an extraction is required.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tooth extraction may be necessary due to severe decay, infection, or crowding. Bracket wearers often need at least one tooth extracted to make space for their new, straighter smile. In addition, people preparing for an organ transplant or enduring chemotherapy may need damaged teeth extracted for oral health.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5846,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/187a-1.jpg" alt="What is a Tooth Extraction Procedure, and Why may you need It?" class="wp-image-5846"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>The Tooth Extraction Procedure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dentist will examine your medical and dental records and take necessary X-rays before extracting a tooth. Radiographs can show a tooth\'s exact size, shape, location, and surrounding bone. Your dentist will use this data to decide whether or not to refer you to an oral surgeon for an extraction.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Usually, dentists or oral surgeons (dentists who have completed additional surgical training) perform a tooth extraction. Your dentist will inject a local anesthetic into the gum tissue around the tooth extraction site to numb the area. Your dentist may choose to use powerful general anesthesia if necessary. It keeps you pain-free and asleep for the entire procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using forceps, the dentist gently moves the impacted tooth back and forth to free it from the jaw bone and ligaments. Sometimes hard-to-pull teeth extraction is done by breaking the tooth into parts. Blood clots occur in the tooth socket after extraction. The dentist will place gauze in the space and have you bite it to halt the bleeding. The dentist may use self-dissolving sutures to seal the gums over the extraction site.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Does tooth extraction have any risks included?\u00a0</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pain, swelling, bruising, bleeding, and infection are common after-effects following tooth extraction. Local or general anesthesia is helpful to numb the area around the tooth or to ensure the patient is comfortable during the extraction. Damage to the mouth, nausea, and dizziness are all possible side effects of the anesthetic.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most patients will temporarily feel discomfort from localized pain, swelling, and bruising, but these adverse effects will fade. Medication such as anti-inflammatories and pain relievers can temporarily relieve these signs and symptoms. The less usual complications of continued bleeding and infection of the area may necessitate additional therapy, such as antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Aftercare\u00a0</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A dentist will send you home to rest after the tooth extraction procedure. Recovery usually takes a few days. The following measures can ease suffering, lessen the likelihood of infection, and expedite healing:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>After a dentist places gauze over a cut, biting on the pad helps halt the bleeding and build a clot. Keep the gauze on for three to four hours until it\'s soaked with blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take prescribed and over-the-counter drugs as directed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>After the surgery, use an ice pack to decrease swelling, ten minutes per use.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Relax and take rest after the extraction of the tooth.&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Don\'t rinse for the next 24 hours after the tooth extraction, and spit gently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>After surgery, eat yogurt, pudding, and or soft-swallowing food.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>After 24 hours, rinse your mouth with half a teaspoon salt in warm water.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tooth extraction can be a scary experience for anybody. Still, whether you\'ve done it before, following your dentist\'s pre-and post-operative instructions is the quickest way to ensure a smooth recovery. The post-surgery instructions a dentist gives for a healthy recovery are essentially the same regardless of which method was used to remove the tooth. A healthy, self-assured grin is worth more than a few compromised teeth, and tooth extraction clears the way for better things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>\u00a0your dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Dental Office</a>,\u00a0to know more about the tooth extraction procedure and why you may need it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/types-of-teeth-whitening-procedures/">Types Of Teeth Whitening Procedures</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>*This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition*</em>\u202f</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

Those needing dental crowns can now select from the Traditional Crown or opt for the faster, more convenient option of a Same-Day CEREC crown in just one dentist visit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What is a same-day crown?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/what-are-cerec-crowns/"><strong>CEREC (Ceramic Reconstruction)</strong></a> is used to create same-day crowns, often known as single-visit crowns. A dentist places a same-day crown in the same manner as a conventional crown. The experts reshape the toot, employing in-office machinery to create the crown. In most cases, the time between taking impressions and receiving the completed crown is only 1-2 hours. On the other hand, now there is no waiting time before one can wear the crown.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What is a Traditional Crown?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lab-created crown is formed in a dental laboratory instead of being made in the dentist\'s office like a <strong><a href="https://pwdds.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-dental-crowns/">traditional crown</a></strong>, composed of gold alloys, base metal alloys, or porcelain-fused-to-metal. A dental lab technician crafts the crown by hand, usually combining materials, including metal and ceramic. The process typically takes two clinical\u202fvisits: the first to prepare the tooth and make the mold, and the second to cement the crown once it has been completed and delivered.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5832,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/119a.jpg" alt="How are Same-Day and Traditional Dental Crowns different?" class="wp-image-5832"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In such a case, which is preferable? Are crowns made in the lab or on the same day?\u202f</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Comparison between the Two</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Time</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To have a same-day crown, you only need to visit the dentist once. Your crown will be made in the office using a CEREC machine after your dentist has created a model of your tooth. When finished, your dentist will prepare your tooth for the new crown and bond it. A complete hour is hardly needed to complete the procedure!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two appointments, one about two weeks apart, are often necessary to place a traditional crown. Tooth requires temporary crowns to safeguard dental treatment; however, they often need to be replaced since they are unstable. Temporary crowns require extreme caution when eating or speaking until the permanent crowns are designed in a dental laboratory, necessitating a visit to the dentist to have it reattached to the dental implant post or natural tooth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Reliability</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dental porcelain used to create same-day crowns is robust and can endure for more than a decade with regular cleanings and checkups. For same-day crowns, ceramic is the material of choice. Although it looks nice, this crown is not nearly as sturdy as one made from the materials used to create a more traditional crown. Thus, a crown made the same day as the tooth may appear better, but it won\'t last as long as one made in a lab.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Crowns produced in a lab out of gold or other metal alloys are the most bizarre looking yet last the longest. Crowns made of porcelain combined with metal are also durable, although they often damage or wear down the teeth on either side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Cost</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might be thinking, "Which one is more expensive?" The price of ceramic crowns may be the same whether you have them created in a dental clinic or a lab. Same-day crowns can be even more reasonable than those made in a lab, although both options are equivalent in price.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since the patients schedule fewer appointments for same-day crowns, they save time and money by not having to miss work as often.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Making the Final Choice</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your final crown selection will depend on your value of portability, comfort, quality, and price.\u202fAlthough traditional crowns are more durable, they require more time and effort to create since they need impressions and a temporary crown. Even though they lack durability, same-day crowns are made fast and delivered the same day. A dentist can guide you in deciding which option is ideal for your situation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>\u00a0your Dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS, at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>, to know more about the Same Day Dental Crowns and Traditional Dental Crowns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/cerec-same-day-crowns/">CEREC Same Day Crowns</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

There are many ways of preventive dentistry, such as taking care of your teeth, which you should begin doing as a youngster and continue doing for the rest of your life.

It\'s composed of several pieces that are fused so that it can fill the gap left by your missing tooth.

Depending on the gap, either a dental bridge is the best option or not. It\'s also essential to assess the anchor teeth to ensure they can withstand the force of a dental prosthesis.

As the most popular kind of bridge, porcelain-fused-to-metal or ceramic bridges are extremely common.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When teeth on either side of the gaps are in good enough health to support a dental bridge, a traditional dental bridge replaces the lost tooth or teeth. Both teeth must be modified and crowned before the bridge placement to ensure they are healthy enough to support the bridge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Maryland Bonded Bridges</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unlike traditional bridges, a Maryland bridge, which is attached to the teeth without crowns, is a more modern alternative. It has wings on either side of the pontic that adhere to your abutment teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To replace a missing front tooth, dentists often employ a Maryland bridge. Less work is involved in constructing these bridges, but this also means they may be less safe than more traditional options.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Cantilever Bridges</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cantilever bridges can put undue stress on anchor teeth. It differs structurally from ordinary bridges in requiring only one anchor tooth. It\'s not common practice to use them, and they usually can only be positioned at the front of the jaw. In the back of the mouth, a cantilever bridge could put undue pressure on one tooth and potentially cause it to break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A cantilever bridge saves time and money, but there aren\'t many scenarios when a bridge of this type would be a good idea. These are the best option for gaps caused by missing teeth when the adjacent teeth are only on one side of the space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Implant-Supported Bridge</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants support implant-supported bridges, which are similar to regular bridges. Because of this, implant-supported bridges can span huge gaps with several missing teeth. Implants are strong, durable, and can restore normal function. This dental bridge involves an intrusive operation and recovery time. Instead of natural teeth, dental implants support retainer crowns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are several dental bridges, but research shows that dental bridges can last for many years with proper care and regular dental checkups. But not everyone can benefit from a dental bridge. Your dentist can advise you on whether or not a dental bridge is necessary and, if so, which category would work best for you. Consult with your dentist about your choices.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Contact\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS, at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a> to learn more about the different types of dental Bridges.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/how-do-fixed-bridges-work/">How Do Fixed Bridges Work?</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It would be wonderful to have pearly white teeth for an entire lifetime. However, our teeth do not remain the same, and it\'s better to accept this. Everyone struggles with teeth staining issues at one or some point in life. Most of it usually comes with age or other factors. At the same time, nobody likes to look in the mirror with discolored teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to ADA estimations, over 37 million Americans use teeth whitening products to eliminate teeth staining. Untreated discolored teeth can give rise to various dental problems\u2014for example, dental caries, gum disease, and tooth decay. Let\'s discover habits that cause stained teeth and what to do if your teeth are already stained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Types of Teeth Stains</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are three primary teeth stains: extrinsic, intrinsic, and age-related stains. Extrinsic stains make their home on the outer part of the tooth, i.e., the enamel. And because they do not enter the inner part, these stains are easier to remove. Intrinsic stains affect the dentin layer, which lies beneath the enamel. These stains are a little harder to remove but are still removable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5734,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/7a.jpg" alt="Everyday Habits That Cause Teeth Staining" class="wp-image-5734"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The age-related stains cause tooth discoloration as age progresses. Here, the enamel gets thinner, and the dentin layer becomes darker. These stains are also difficult to remove, but professional teeth whitening procedures can significantly help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, the question arises, what causes teeth stains? There are a couple of reasons that cause stained teeth. These include medications, trauma, the aging process, amalgam restorations, oral diseases, poor dental hygiene, excess fluoride, etc. Here, we\'ll look deeply into some everyday habits that cause stained teeth so that you can play your role. Let\'s explore them one by one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Everyday Habits That Cause Stained Teeth</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Drinking Teeth-Staining Beverages</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many teeth-staining beverages cause teeth staining. These include coffee, cola, soda, tea, sports, carbonated drinks, energy drinks, citrus juice, etc. It\'s better to limit these drinks as much as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, some people can\'t live without tea or coffee. In that case, it would be best to rinse your mouth after taking them so that the acidic nature of these beverages does not stain your teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Drinking Non-Fluoridated Water</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you drink non-fluoridated water, it can increase the likelihood of getting stains. Therefore, keep yourself well-hydrated and incorporate some sources of fluoride in your daily intake.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Eating Staining Foods</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just like drinks can stain your teeth, many foods can do the same. Limit foods with intense colors, such as berries, lollipops, and beetroots. Similarly, avoid acidic and sugary foods that can wear down the enamel.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, some foods are essential and healthy, despite their color. You can\'t limit their use. In that case, maintain good oral hygiene and rinse after taking every meal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Inappropriate Oral Hygiene Practices</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regular brushing and flossing are essential to remove tartar and plaque buildup. Poor oral hygiene practices ruin the teeth\' appearance, turning yellow or brown.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5735,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5a.jpg" alt="Everyday Habits That Cause Teeth Staining" class="wp-image-5735"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Smoking</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The nicotine and tar content in tobacco causes stained teeth.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It\'s essential to make regular dentist visits to maintain excellent oral health for you and your family. Having a family dentist is convenient and best for a dental emergency. It simplifies oral care, and tracking dental history becomes relatively easy. However, finding the best family dentist can be challenging. You want someone who can treat you professionally and with compassion, whereas very few excel in these two domains.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, we live in a digital age where finding the right dentist is easier than ever. You can find a lot of information about a particular dentist by reading online reviews and exploring his website. But what should you look to make a decision? The following guideline is all there to help you find the right dentist near you. So, let\'s start.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Aim for Convenience</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Convenience is an essential factor, especially when you are choosing a family dentist. The dental office should be close to your home or workplace so that you can easily visit the dentist or take your family members with ease for regular dental visits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, consider office hours apart from the location. It may be hard for you to visit the dentist when he has the same office hours as you. Choose a dentist who works late hours at least once a week so that he can accommodate your needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Look for Comprehensive Services</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting comprehensive care under one roof makes life much easier. It is especially true when trying to meet multiple family members\' dental needs. A family dentist should be able to provide a wide range of services, for instance:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5709,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/917.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5709"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Fillings, root canals, and crown placement.</li><li>Children\'s dentistry.</li><li>Dental implants.</li><li>Clear braces.</li><li>Gum disease treatment.</li><li>Dental implants.</li><li>Dentures.</li><li>TMJ Therapy, etc.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, ensure the chosen dentist offers emergency services, treats patients of all ages, and is well-equipped with modern technology.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Ask People for Recommendations</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It\'s always good to ask for recommendations from people whom you trust. These can come from your loved ones, family circle, co-workers, or even your general health physician. Shortlist a few dentists to find the right one who shares values similar to yours.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finding the right dentist is imperative for achieving the best oral health. Therefore, take your time and research to find an empathetic dentist for your entire family.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Check out the Doctor\'s Credentials and Qualifications</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you have explored the websites of various dentists, it\'s time to check out their credentials and qualifications. Check out the doctors\' bios which include information like the institutes they studied from, their expertise, priorities, and experiences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pick the one that has worked with kids, adults, and the elderly population. It will be suitable for your family in the long run. After you choose a particular dentist, visit his office before scheduling your first appointment. Also, see the office\'s environment and the staff\'s expertise, and get to know patients\' experiences. It will aid in finding the right dentist for your family.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Read Online Reviews</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5708,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/918.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5708"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The local online reviews on Google and social media can help find the right family dentist. Look for dentists with at least 4+ ratings on various platforms and shortlist by reading patients\' positive reviews. The more positive reviews reflect excellent expertise in dealing with patients.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Online reviews can say a lot about a particular dentist. Get to know patients\' experiences and pick the dentist accordingly. A good family dentist adheres to the patient\'s demands and has superb listening skills.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The procedure for a root canal is where a dental professional removes bacteria or dead tissue from the tooth, relieving pain caused by an infected or abscessed tooth. The dentist drains out the inflamed pulp during the root canal procedure and cleans the inner surfaces of the tooth to disinfect it, followed by the placement of a filling to seal the space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Toothache is the first sign that you might need a root canal. The pain can range from mild to extremely bad, and your gums may also hurt and swell up where the problem is. You should visit your dentist if the toothache is persistent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Steps Involved in Root Canal Procedure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, a root canal may sound frightening, but the truth is that a root canal may be made painless because of developments in dentistry. Root canal procedure\u202ftypically involves two or three clinic visits and includes the following methods:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#1 \u2013 Dental Examination</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5702,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/822.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5702"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dentist will first examine your teeth. You may have to get one or two X-rays to know the intensity of inflammation and tooth decay. Once your tooth is diagnosed with the infection, the dentist uses a Local anesthesia injection, numbing the tooth for treatment and surrounding tissues. It may take some time to numb a tooth with acutely irritated pulp, but your dentist will wait to begin treatment until you are comfortable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#2 \u2013 Dental Dam Placement</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dentist will then place a dental dam - a thin sheet of rubber or vinyl on the affected tooth to expose it while the natural teeth are covered. It helps to perform\u202fthe root canal procedure in a sterile condition, free from contamination by microorganisms present in saliva or the rest of the mouth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#3 \u2013 Creation of Access Point</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, the dentist will make a tiny hole in the tooth\'s biting point, or top, to access the pulp chamber and root canal. This opening provides access for treatment to the pulp chamber and root canals. Although it might appear scary,\u202fthis part won\'t hurt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5703,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/821.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5703"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#4 \u2013 Cleaning Process</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dentist will then use a set of surgical tools to clean out root canals of the tooth- the pulp chamber and possibly apply antiseptic/antibiotics to ensure no infection is left to cause pain. This procedure is not painful; the area is numb, and the removed tissue is either dead or dying.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#5 \u2013 Sterilization</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After removing the infected tissues, the dentist will add a small cotton ball soaked in the antiseptic liquid to sterilize the channels to eliminate any remaining bacteria. The tooth will have a temporary filling, and you will be sent home with the given medications. Your dentist will schedule you for a next appointment at this stage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#6 \u2013 Removal of Temporary Fillings</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dentist removes the temporary filling at your second appointment. To properly seal the channels, your dentist will add adhesive fillers. Later the dentist might use small files to shape the inner chamber to fill the canals with the gutta-percha substance (rubber-like material): To make it fit against the walls, the dentist compresses it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#7 \u2013 Tooth Impression</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that your tooth is ready for the permanent crown to cover, the dentist will take an impression of your tooth with a silicone-based material, and your tooth impression will then be sent to the lab to get your crown. The clinic will then call you once your crown is ready.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Final Step \u2013 Crown Placement</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dental professional completes the procedure by placing a permanent crown on the tooth. To make the crown placement or restoration stable, the dentist might need to insert a small post for additional support inside the root chamber, depending on the state of your original tooth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After completing root canal therapy, you must take proper care of your teeth and gums. Keep up effective oral hygiene practices at home by brushing twice daily, flossing once daily, and scheduling regular dental cleanings and exams. After a root canal procedure, the tooth stays healthy for the rest of your life with the proper care and attention.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS, at\u00a0Procopio Towle Dental Office to learn more about the root canal procedure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/how-is-a-root-canal-procedure-done/">How Is A Root Canal Procedure Done?</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

One of the most underrated things about cosmetic dentistry is its ability to change someone\u2019s life significantly. Think about people with severe bleeding, swelling, and a bruised face after an accident or a challenging sport. What\u2019s the way forward? Several studies indicate that people who undergo facial injuries have elevated anxiety, depression, and a feeling of worthlessness.

This article will discuss the benefits of cosmetic dentistry that you should know as an educated individual. So, let\u2019s begin and get to know these life-changing benefits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Benefit # 1: Live a Healthier Life</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5693,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/793.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5693"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Suppose you lose some of your teeth during a dental emergency.

A dental crown saves and protects a compromised tooth and keeps it away from further decay and damage. Besides giving better aesthetics, the dental crown help relieves discomfort. Thanks to modern dentistry, you can enjoy the benefits of same-day crowns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental crowns are available in two types, i.e., traditional and same-day dental crowns. Both are effective and provide restorative treatment to save a tooth prone to excessive usage, broken, chipped, or damaged. However, the latter saves your time and an extra trip to the dentist. Moreover, there is no need for temporary crown placement as with the traditional crown. Many people are still unaware of the fact that same-day crowns exist. However, this article aims to enlighten you so you can make an informed decision. So, let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What Is a Same-Day Crown?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5687,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/746.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5687"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the same suggests, the same-day crown is a single-visit crown created right in your dentist\u2019s office. Same-day crowns are as efficient as traditional crowns and last for about 10-15 years on average. However, with excellent care, they can even last for a decade or even throughout your lifetime.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The lab-created crowns usually require at least two dental appointments for the entire procedure. Moreover, the permanent crown takes around 2-3 weeks to prepare before it can place in the patient\u2019s mouth. Busy people mostly want treatment in just one sitting and can avail of same-day crown placement.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Same-day crowns use CEREC technology and are highly convenient. They provide significant restoration to the affected tooth and do not require any temporary crown placement. Learn more benefits about same-day crowns from the information given below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>5 Benefits of Same-Day Crowns</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Same-day crowns offer a cost-effective way to restore a tooth. Traditional crowns are also cost-effective compared to dental implants. However, same-day crowns are more cost-effective because they do not require a second dental visit. Moreover, there is no need to pay an extra fee for placing a temporary crown as traditional crown placement does.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>More Comfortable</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fixing and placing a temporary crown might not be comfortable for many people. Same-day crowns eliminate your need for temporary crowns as you can get them immediately. They might also bring added tooth sensitivity to the tooth under treatment. So, same-day crowns are more comfortable and allow a snugger fit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Provide Greater Protection</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Same-day crowns provide excellent and instant protection to the damaged tooth due to their efficient single-sitting placement. The purpose of conventional crowns is also to protect the affected tooth. However, the same-day crown method provides added protection because the temporary crown isn\u2019t required. A temporary crown does not cover the tooth or protect it from decay. Moreover, a temporary crown does not always fit well in the patient\u2019s mouth and can come loose.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>No Worries About Impression Putty</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many patients cannot tolerate impression putty as it induces a natural gag reflex. Instead, the dentist takes digital impressions of the affected tooth and does not require invasive measures. If they opt for same-day crowns, they can eliminate this dental anxiety.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Designed With More Precision</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dentist works on the same day crown until it\u2019s perfect in all dimensions. Same-day crowns use CEREC technology that gives them more precision than traditional crowns. They look better, are perfectly natural, aid in chewing food, and are highly durable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why not avail yourself of a same-day crown to restore your tooth and beautify your smile? Same-day crowns immediately restore the tooth\u2019s integrity and imperfection. Creating these crowns using biocompatible material gives added protection that saves a tooth from further decay. Instead of waiting for weeks, you can get same-day crowns within the same day. They have a quicker turnaround and are highly budget-friendly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>,\u00a0to know more about the benefits of Same-Day Crowns</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="http://CEREC Same Day Crowns">CEREC Same Day Crowns</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

Dental implants are a viable alternative to fixed bridges and partial dentures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most healthy adults are good candidates for dental implants who are missing one or more of their teeth. However, one needs to get evaluated to see if he is the right candidate for implant surgery. Continue reading to know the characteristics that determine the best candidate for dental implants. Doing so will help you prepare for the procedure after consulting your dentist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Characteristics of the Best Candidate for Dental Implants</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Implant surgery is a popular dental treatment for tooth restoration. According to the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, more than half a million people opt for dental implants yearly. This figure is in addition to millions of people who have already had implant surgery in the past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, dental implants do not suit everyone. It illustrates that we must look at characteristics determining the ideal patient for implant surgery. So, let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Good health</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyone in good overall health is an ideal candidate for dental implants. The implant surgery requires the patient to not suffer from illnesses like diabetes, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. These things prevent the implant from fusing with the patient\u2019s jawbone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly, if the patient is on any prior medication, it can interfere with calcium processing, for instance. It might damage the jawbone\u2019s ability to heal around the implant screw. Patients on chemotherapy aren\u2019t the best candidates for implants as this therapy weakens the bone structure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Adequate Bone Density</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants also require sufficient bone density for their protection and support. The patient must have a strong jaw to anchor implants. People who have inadequate bone density can still get the implants. However, they\u2019ll require a procedure before placing the implants, i.e., bone grafting. It helps rebuild the patient\u2019s bone to make it easier for implant placement.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Healthy Gums</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Healthy gums are a prerequisite for implant surgery. Ideally, patients should not suffer from gum diseases like periodontitis or gingivitis. They must cure them if they have such conditions before opting for the implant\u2019s procedure. The implants cannot heal correctly if the gums are weak. Therefore, the patient\u2019s gums must be healthy to support and bond with the implants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5547,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/416.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5547"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Great Oral Health Hygiene</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An ideal candidate should also have great oral health hygiene. It is crucial because such patients can care for their implants better. Dental implants, once placed, require adequate caring so that they can last for long. Patients who are already fond of maintaining their oral health hygiene would be willing to care for them appropriately.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Minimal Bruxism</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Patients who struggle with teeth clenching or grinding risk failing to achieve the optimum benefits of dental implants. Dental implants require patience from the patient\u2019s side so that he doesn\u2019t exert pressure on teeth when faced with anxiety. If a patient cannot control clenching his teeth as a way of his habit, he is not a well-suited candidate for implants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants might be the best option if your oral health isn\u2019t in good shape and you want a durable treatment. However, you need to fulfill the essential criteria to avail of the treatment. If you aren\u2019t a tobacco user and have a generally good state of health, you might be an ideal candidate.

The benefits of mobile dentistry are numerous; however, this article will enlighten you with the top 5 benefits. So, let\u2019s discuss and get to know them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Keep Patients in Their Comfort Zone</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some patients do not like to visit the hospital due to several reasons. It might be because they feel frustrated with waiting for their turn or cannot travel. However, they need treatment on an immediate basis but cannot go out to see a dentist. A mobile dental unit can provide significant help in this regard. It keeps patients in their comfort zone, getting appropriate consultation and quality treatment for their problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5543,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/351.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5543"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Offers Easy Access to Everyone</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry offers easy access to oral health care to all societal groups. Be it the elderly population, disadvantaged groups, marginalized communities, or otherwise, a mobile dental unit is easily accessible.

Rather, it treats everyone with dignity and respect and helps to resolve patients\u2019 issues quickly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Blessing To the Elderly</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry is a promising way to reach out to the elderly population. Studies reveal that many of the elderly population who lives in nursing homes need adequate oral health care. They feel deprived of one of their few remaining pleasures of life if not treated well on time. Oral conditions adversely impact seniors\u2019 quality of life, jeopardizing their nutritional status.

For instance, children cannot go out without parents who they might stick in their busy work schedules. Similarly, at times, there is a dental emergency, and the patient is alone at home and can\u2019t leave to avail of the treatment. In such a case, mobile dentistry is of valuable help. It provides immediate dental care at the doorstep, where patients feel receive quality treatment within the comfort of the mobile unit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Expands The Patient Base Exponentially</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry helps to boost dental practice. It expands the patient base exponentially and has low startup costs than a traditional clinic. A dentist can increase his efficiency with the help of modern dental care and advanced materials. Moreover, he can work on new cases to boost his dental experience while working within the community.\u202f\u202f</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry focuses on the disadvantaged groups of society. It helps alleviate their problems instantly. Patients receive an efficient, accurate, and friendly quality of treatment from certified and trained medical staff. This way, they do not need to go out and wait for long hours to fix their dental problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead, they receive immediate help and feel relaxed after getting the treatment.

They are made of acrylic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Partial Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Partial dentures are mostly made of the metal framework and prevent teeth from shifting. They help to replace one or more missing teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5525,"width":263,"height":175,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/314.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5525" width="263" height="175"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Implant-Supported Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These dentures combine two modern prosthetics, i.e., dentures and implants.

However, the patient has to be a good candidate for these dentures. They are ready the same day the patient undergoes tooth extraction or removal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Snap-in Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These dentures are highly stable and add convenience to the patient\'s life.

These dentures are generic and therefore need denture adhesive for securing them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Fixed Bridge</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fixed bridges replace missing teeth by surgically cementing a crown at each side of the remaining teeth.

Waiting for dental issues to show prognosis is the worst you can do to your oral health. A family dentist can offer you regular visits for checkups to check the condition of your oral health. So, all the problems can get diagnosis as early as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Benefits of having a family dentist</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5><strong>More convenient and reliable</strong>:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having a family dentist is very convenient in many ways. If your dentist is not good in pediatric dentistry, you can get recommendations from him instead of worrying about not knowing where to go. You can make appointments at any time regardless of your busy schedule. They can compensate and manage time for you, and you do not have to wait at the clinic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As far as trust and reliability are concerned, you have been seeing a doctor for your dental issues for quite a long time which means you already trust him. Your dentist knows your family history, genetics, and any pre-existing diseases. If you have, you will ultimately get the treatments accordingly. He will prescribe your medicine keeping in mind if you are allergic to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Regular service and long-lasting relationship</strong>:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can get any service whenever you want, and the best part is that you will get genuine consultations on any of your dental issues. A family dentist is best for getting regular checkups to improve your oral health. And this also reduces the risks of getting infections. Your dentist can identify and diagnose the issue earlier to treat it at the right time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having a long relationship with your dentist is very convenient if you will get any special dental treatment like dental crowns, bridges, etc. Dental implants require a long time to heal, and along relationship with the doctor can help you follow up on the treatment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5239,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/268.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5239"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Family vs. General dentist</strong>:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is little difference in the educational background of the people and general dentists, but their clinical practices can make a huge difference.

A family dentist is more convenient as they already know your history and other dental problems.

An endodontist is a specialist dentist specializing in treating affected teeth by performing root canal therapy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Global statistics show that 97% of root canal treatments are successful. 85% of the infected tooth fixed by root canal can last a lifetime. During this procedure, the endodontist carefully removes the infected pulp and seals the affected tooth to prevent the recurrence of the infection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The symptoms of an infected root canal system vary among people. However, the treatment plan is almost the same for everyone. Continue reading to know if you are curious about who needs root canal therapy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Symptoms of Infected Root Canal System</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most common symptoms of an infected root canal system are below. If you experience any of these, be ready to visit your dentist before it gets too late. If you experience any of these symptoms, there are high chances that you need root canal therapy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5234,"width":279,"height":230,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/151.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5234" width="279" height="230"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Tooth Discoloration</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the pulp becomes infected, the tooth\'s appearance changes to grayish-black. When this happens, the person needs root canal therapy to treat the underlying infection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Constant Toothache</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People who need root canal therapy have constant irritation or pain in the tooth. This discomfort is not stimulated or initiated by any mouth activity. Instead, it happens because the pulp or soft tissue inside the root canal system becomes infected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Lingering Sensitivity</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another symptom to look for is tooth sensitivity. When a person\'s tooth becomes extremely sensitive to hot or cold foods, it might indicate a need for root canal therapy. This symptom is significant to consider when people experience tooth sensitivity for prolonged periods after food consumption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Swollen Gums or Jaw</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Swollen or sore gums indicate an infection in the pulp. So, if you experience swelling on the gums, visit your dentist right away to check whether you need root canal therapy. Some people develop a boil or pimple on their gums. It causes an unpleasant taste or smell when the pus from the infected tooth drains from the boil or pimple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, the jaw becomes visibly swollen, and the pus doesn\'t strain from the side. In such a case, it is better to visit your dentist at your earliest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5235,"width":283,"height":283,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/153.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5235" width="283" height="283"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you see any of these symptoms, they might qualify you as a candidate for root canal therapy.

Bacteria in a chipped or cracked tooth can easily reach the tooth pulp and cause infection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An infected tooth can also feel looser, or you continuously experience pain while chewing food.

All dental diseases arrive from poor oral health other than broken teeth due to trauma or facial injuries. Brushing twice a day is not the only care you have to follow as a preventive measure for better oral health. Flossing at least thrice a week helps get rid of the trapped germs and food particles. Using the right type and amount of toothpaste also helps improve oral health. Moreover, fluoride-containing toothpaste helps whiten teeth and provides necessary minerals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Regular visits to the clinic:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can get the right treatment only when you diagnose the problem at the right time. We often delay our visits to the clinic, taking small infections lightly. These are the germs that later spread to the other teeth and cause serious tooth decay, leading to losing natural teeth. If you treat the problem at the right time, you can save your teeth. Besides this, there must be awareness regarding regular dental checkups whether you have a dental problem. Sometimes brushing and flossing do not help clean the mouth thoroughly, so we need regular cleaning from professionals to remove the micro germs and retain the natural shine of our teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Mouthguards:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5206,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/108.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5206"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bruxism or teeth grinding is a sleeping habit that can cause crooked teeth. This can damage the teeth and affect the jawbone and physical appearance of your mouth. If you have teeth-grinding, mouthguards or nightguards are the best preventive tools to keep your teeth safe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Fluoride treatments:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our teeth need minerals for their better health and strength. These minerals come from our diet and toothpaste, but sometimes lack of certain types of diet due to any reason can lead to demineralization of the teeth. Fluoride treatment is for the remineralization of the teeth to make them work properly and gives them a bleaching effect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Practicing preventive care makes you less likely to face any dental issue in the future and reduces the risk of teeth loss at an older age. Getting regular checkups and following good oral hygiene should be taken seriously for every age group to avoid any complications in the future.

First, the cosmetic dentist connects a screw to the jaw to maintain it. Next, the implant is attached to the missing tooth\'s bone socket. With time, the teeth and the bone fuses with the implant, which secures the replacing tooth. After attachment, the implant will blend with the teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Cost of Cosmetic Dentistry Treatments</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Insurance companies normally do not cover these procedures, so the amount varies for each treatment.

The tooth decay in the back teeth is usually not noticeable due to the painless condition. And maybe the plaque is located at the backside or between the two teeth. It becomes severe when it transforms into cavities which can lead to tooth extraction in the future if not treated correctly and on time. So, visiting a dental clinic plays a massive role in saving your natural teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>To educate yourself on dental issues:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we get a dental issue at the start, we begin to treat it at home according to our knowledge which is not helpful. All dental problems have different causes and treatments due to various reasons. Diagnosing and treating the exact problem can help you get prompt treatment with quick recovery and prevent damage to other healthy teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Much information about any dental problem is available on the internet, but it only lets us know about the cause and the treatment.

We don\u2019t know when the problem has started in our teeth, and it starts spreading slowly with time. Regular visits to the clinic help identify the problem as soon as possible and treat it accordingly. In this way, there will be no severe conditions in the future, and you will enjoy a beautiful smile for your whole life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are still doubting the importance of regular dental visits, look at all their benefits. It is best to know the problems early as prevention is always better than the cure. Regular visits provide the most significant advantage in enjoying your favorite food and having that beautiful smile. This increases self-esteem and boosts confidence.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chronic bad breath or halitosis occurs in almost 25% of people in the total population. It can become very embarrassing over time if not treated properly. There are many options available in the market for treating bad breath. Still, those are temporary solutions, like mouthwashes or mouth fresheners. However, if the underlying cause remains untreated, it is impossible to permanently get rid of the bad breath. So knowing the cause of halitosis is the first step toward its treatment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Causes:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Poor oral hygiene:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you eat something, the first place where food enters and gets crushed is your mouth. Food particles get stuck between the teeth and in the pointed ends of our molars and premolars. When the germs contact these food particles, they start deteriorating, and the teeth get contaminated. These residing food particles cause bad breath by releasing harmful products. These germs then cause cavities and plaque, which gets piled up on the teeth, thus causing permanent bad breath if it remains uncleaned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Dry mouth:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some medical conditions like xerostomia cause chronic dry mouth, which also causes bad breath. The saliva produced in our mouth helps detoxify and cleanse gums. It neutralizes the acidic pH of the mouth and reduces the chances of bacterial growth. The morning breath is also caused due to a dry mouth because saliva is not frequently produced while sleeping, and it gets worse if the mouth remains open.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5142,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vigo-17.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5142"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Drugs:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some drugs are broken down into smaller compounds and release chemicals that cause bad breath, e.g., some tranquilizers and nitrates. Some medications like antibiotics cause dry mouth by decreasing the amount of released saliva and contributing to mouth odor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other conditions like tobacco smoking and some medical conditions like mouth and throat illness are also the reasons for chronic bad breath.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Treatment:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first-line treatment is cleaning the teeth properly and thoroughly. If the odor is due to plaque, cavities, or poor oral hygiene, getting the teeth cleaned once by the dentist can help you get rid of the odor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Brushing the teeth twice and flossing them twice a week is the best step toward treating bad breath permanently.</li><li>Anything that goes into your mouth, like dentures, should be cleaned daily.</li><li>Suppose the bad breath is due to underlying medical conditions. In that case, treating the diseases first is the only way to solve the bad breath problems.</li><li>Avoid dry mouth and clean your tongue to remove the residue of the food.</li><li>Avoid tobacco and foods that release chemicals causing odor like onions and garlic. Using a mouthwash after eating anything which causes a bad smell is recommended.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking care of your oral hygiene is as important as cleaning your teeth. If the chronic bad breath persists even after following all the precautions and proper cleaning, visit your doctor or dentist to know the underlying cause and get it treated on time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To find out solutions to Chronic Bad Breath,\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>\u00a0your Dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/toothache-remedies/">Toothache Remedies</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition.\u202f</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the past, with just a little development in the dental field, patients had to bear a lot of pain during dental surgeries. But now it\'s 2022, and sedation dentistry has all the solutions to your distress. You don\'t need to wait until the last moment to visit the dentist for a detailed checkup or avoid dental visits for fear of pain during the surgery. With sedation dentistry, even tooth extraction doesn\'t feel painful, so dental treatments are much more convenient for people, and they are encouraged to go to a clinic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Methods of Sedation:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Oral Sedation:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5044,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vig-39.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5044"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The oral sedation pills produce unconsciousness in patients. They make the patient drowsy and sleepy during dental treatments. Oral sedation, as compared to other types of sedation, produce more after-effects. The patient will not be able to drive him home safely, so he needs someone to monitor because the consciousness comes after some time when the effect of the pills goes down. If a kid is getting oral sedation, parents must supervise their children until he is fully awake and conscious. It can take a few hours to one day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Laughing gas:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Laughing gas works wonders when it comes to moderate sedation. It takes just a few moments to start the sedation and is easy to wear off. Your dentist will give you a mask to place on your nose and will ask you to take deep breaths so that the gas can travel through your nostrils. Once it starts going inside, the process of sedation begins within seconds. The patient cannot feel pain and discomfort during the process but is fully awake. The after-effects are very few, so it is safe to drive yourself home after getting the treatment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>IV Sedation:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5045,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vig-38.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5045"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>IV sedation uses the intravenous method to insert the anesthesia. It can be local and general anesthesia. The local anesthesia only produces sedation in a specific part, like the gums only for teeth extraction. The patient remains awake but can feel no pain or discomfort. General anesthesia is not particular to a special region. Rather, it produces unconsciousness and causes the whole body to rest. The IV insertion mostly uses the arm veins for injection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Types of sedative drugs:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For laughing gas sedation, nitrous oxide is used widely to produce unconsciousness. Sedative pills like diazepam, zaleplon, triazolam, and midazolam are prescribed for oral sedation. Most dentists use liquid sedative drugs and IV methods for insertion because of their safety and no side effects. All the benzodiazepines like valium, versed, and Ativan are preferred for IV sedation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sedation dentistry is used to induce unconsciousness during the treatment process. However, a little pain that comes after the effect of sedative drugs wears down is normal. You can avoid the pain with mild painkillers and do not try to put pressure on the treated tooth right after the treatment. In case of any after-effects of sedation, contact your dentist immediately.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To find out more about Sedation Dentistry,&nbsp;<a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>&nbsp;your Dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at&nbsp;<a href="https://pwdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/the-benefits-of-preventive-dentistry/">The Benefits of Preventive Dentistry</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>\u202f</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

People need fillings when only a small portion of the tooth is damaged.

The exterior faces damage due to the wear and tear process and maybe aggressively eating solid foods. Dental crowns are the caps of your teeth size which cover the surface and provide a healthy surface area for chewing. They are attached with the teeth glue or cement, so there is no chance of them falling off the surface.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Dental Implants:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are the perfect and permanent fit for your missing teeth.

Therefore, people used restorative methods to ensure tooth functionality to fill this gap. There can be various options for doing this process, and fixed bridges are the most widely used ones. In this article, we will discuss the principles and how do fixed bridges work and throw light on what to expect from this treatment. So, let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Working Principles of Fixed Bridges:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Fixed bridge is tooth-colored and works just like natural teeth. It is super easy to maintain and does not fall out of place compared to partial dentures. It is fixed in the mouth to ease up the patient\u2019s tasks, and he can sleep and eat with it comfortably.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fixed bridges work in a way that they fill the gap created by the missing teeth. It does this by securing a false tooth to the surrounding teeth, which acts as a bridge between their healthy teeth. The surrounding teeth help protect and hold the bridge to the maximum extent. The patient can easily chew and smile with confidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bridge placement is not a surgical procedure, and the patient stays awake during the treatment. However, the dentist might use mild sedation to relax the patient, especially if he becomes anxious. The dentist will use local anesthesia to numb the area of the mouth, and the medication will be injected directly into the gums.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, the supporting teeth will be prepared to make room for the crown placement. Afterward, the dentist will take an impression of the teeth. It is sent to the laboratory to create a custom bridge. The dentist will then make a temporary bridge to protect the patient\u2019s mouth. The temporary bridge is then replaced by the permanent bridge on the next dental visit. It is carefully cemented to ensure the best results.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":4673,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/vig-19.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4673"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What to Expect from This Treatment?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the dental bridge procedure is done, the patient might feel numb for a few hours. The numbness is felt in the tongue, gums, and mouth because of the local anesthesia. Patients might also feel some tenderness, and there is a minor sensitivity to hot and cold items for a few days. A modest amount of discomfort can be there, and you can approach your dentist if they reach a concerning level. However, you can gargle by mixing four ounces of warm water and one tablespoon of salt to ease up any discomfort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maintaining dental hygiene is a crucial factor in ensuring the bridge\u2019s success. So, take care of your dental bridge to enjoy your life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fixed bridge treatment helps you to feel more confident about your smile and dental health. They are highly stable and durable appliances that offer numerous benefits to patients. If you plan to restore your tooth with this treatment, consult a dentist near you to do the procedure.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental Veneers are undoubtedly the best way for modern dentistry to mimic nature. Cosmetic dentistry has always sought to imitate nature rather than improve it. Porcelain veneers aren\'t the only way to change a person\'s smile, but they\'re a popular choice for patients who want a lot of control over their appearance (change color, size, shape, etc.). Veneers are a quick way to improve the appearance of your teeth and are ideal for people who have stained, chipped, or gapped teeth. On the other hand, Veneers are a long-term solution, and having them placed is a significant investment. Before you and your dentist decide whether veneers are right for you, you should educate yourself on everything you can about them, including how much they cost and how to care for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":4651,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/vig-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4651"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A veneer is a tooth-colored, wafer-thin shell that covers the front surface of teeth to improve appearance while providing strength and resilience like natural tooth enamel. During in-office procedures, they are customized to the shape of your teeth and bonded to the tooth\'s original enamel. Porcelain or resin composite materials are used to create dental veneers. We\'ll go over the distinctions between the two in more detail below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Why Do Dentists Recommend Dental Veneers?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Veneers are a more discrete option than crowns or braces. They can be used to fill in gaps and fix minor alignment issues. Veneers are also used as a cosmetic solution to brighten and straighten teeth and correct issues like discoloration, fractures, and chips.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What Is the Difference Between Porcelain And Composite Veneers?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":4655,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/vig-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4655"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most common veneer materials are traditional porcelain veneers and composite resin veneers. Porcelain veneers are the best option for correcting shape and color issues, and they have a lifespan of 10 to 20 years. Porcelain veneers are typically half the price of composite veneers. In most cases, composites can be created while you wait, allowing for same-day treatment. Instead of being shaped and sculpted in a separate lab, they are shaped and carved on your teeth. Another benefit of composite veneers is their reversibility. Porcelain veneers require the reshaping of your natural teeth to accommodate the veneer. Composites require only minor prep work on your natural teeth, which means they are not permanently altered to the point where the composite material cannot be removed and replaced as needed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Porcelain vs. Resin Veneers: What\'s the Difference?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As previously stated, porcelain veneers have several advantages, but you may also be familiar with resin composite veneers. Either of these materials is used to make them. Consult your dentist to find out which material is best for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The resin composite option is customized to your smile and designed to appear natural. This material is also highly durable, and with proper maintenance, it can last for several years. The most significant disadvantage of resin composite is that it is not stain-resistant, which means it will darken over time, just like natural teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>&nbsp;your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at&nbsp;<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>&nbsp;today to learn more about Dental Veneers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Resource: </h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/the-step-by-step-guide-to-dentures/">The step-by-step guide to dentures.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*Neither this nor any other content in this media is meant to prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.

        '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Composite fillings are becoming more popular than ever throughout the world. Whether you need filling in your front or back teeth, the composite fillings are perfect to choose, especially if you are looking for aesthetically pleasing filling material. Composite fillings easily bond with the tooth and give it great strength. It also helps to prevent any further damage making it one of the best benefits of composite fillings. These dental fillings have no mercury content, so they do not cause any long-term health effects as they are toxic-free.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Traditionally, amalgam or special-alloys fillings were used to fill tooth cavities. However, with the advancement in modern dental medicine, composite fillings are mostly recommended by dentists to fill the holes that are caused by tooth decay and cavities. There are numerous reasons for it. Here, we would like to educate you about the five notable benefits of composite fillings. So, let\u2019s this article serve you as an enlightening personal filling fact sheet so that you can consider it for treating your cavities in the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 1: Requires Less Drilling</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Compared to other filling types, the composite fillings require less drilling, and much less tooth must be removed. The amalgam fillings, for instance, require heavy drilling where a significant portion of the natural tooth must be removed, which causes a weak tooth structure. On the other hand, the composite fillings result in an overall stronger tooth without causing any harm to the tooth structure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 2: Bonds Extremely Well.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another benefit of composite fillings is that they bond exceptionally well with the original tooth and are custom crafted in the lab. They are aesthetically pleasing to patients. When bonded with the tooth enamel, they provide an added strength to the tooth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 3: Fewer Instances of Tooth Sensitivity.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Composite fillings have fewer instances of tooth sensitivity because the resin insulates the tooth against cold and hot temperatures. However, after the treatment, there are some chances of mild tooth sensitivity, which eventually goes away after some time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 4: Easily Repaired.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the composite fillings get damaged for some reason, they can be repaired. Be it hard chewing; teeth grinding, or otherwise; the composite fillings might degrade; the dentist will clean the area first and then fill it again. Moreover, the old amalgam fillings can also be replaced by composite fillings, especially if you are worried about your health due to mercury content.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 5: Fix Cracks and Chips.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The natural-colored appearance, quick bonding, and durability of composite fillings make them ideal for repairing or fixing chips and cracks in visible teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Conclusion:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the benefits of composite fillings are generally more durable and do not expand or contract like amalgam fillings. They look like natural teeth and bond extraordinarily well with the tooth enamel. It can be quickly placed within just a single sitting and fosters a healthy tooth structure. Visit your dentist if you have a tooth cavity and talk about composite fillings to restore your dental needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>&nbsp;your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at&nbsp;<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>&nbsp;today to learn more about composite fillings.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings-procedures-in-walnut-creek/">Dental Fillings</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>*Neither this nor any other content in this media is meant to prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fWe\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

The treatment plan determines how far your teeth have to travel and for how long. The Invisalign lab receives your x-rays, 3D model, and photos of your teeth.

Your teeth will start shifting in a few days. After a while, your aligners will feel loose. Keep them even if they begin to feel loose. So no need to get rid of them. Adjustment is required for your teeth and gums. It\'s risky to switch aligners too early in the process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every six weeks, we\'ll check your aligners and track your progress. These tests help us decide whether to change your treatment plan or aligners. The length of Invisalign treatment depends on the patient\'s age and needs.

Root Canal Procedure is a type of endodontic treatment used to clean the inside of the teeth: a pulp or root canal. The process is carried out in various steps but that doesn\'t mean that you have to visit the clinic each step individually. The treatment solely involves only two visits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Procedure For RCT</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1. Getting Initial Tests Done</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"left","id":4331,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/professional-dentist-examination-patient-with-microscope-office-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4331"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first clinic visit, which is not a part of the treatment, is for all the tests to determine if you require RCT and which teeth need what kind of therapy. It includes a comprehensive oral exam and X-rays to identify your teeth. Any misaligned teeth or jawbone resorption are treated accordingly. Assume you have periodontitis or oral cavity illness. In that situation, the disease must be treated first to avoid therapy problems. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. Thoroughly Cleaning The Pulp:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The root canal is cleaned properly before getting into the next step. Many people claim that RCT is painful, and it\'s better to pull out a tooth than get RCT. Let us dispel the myth that the process doesn\'t cause pain like all other dental procedures. It\'s always preferred to save your natural teeth instead of getting artificial ones. The patient is given local anesthesia, which produces numbness in that specific area of your oral cavity or teeth line. In this way, the candidate does not feel any pain at all. A whole is made to clean out the dead pulp and other excessive reading inside your teeth. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.

After shaping the canals, they are cleaned again to receive the material. The material which is preferably used to fill up your canals is "gutta-percha" having rubber-like consistency. After adding it into canals, it is heated to fit and attaches firmly to the walls. The canals are then sealed to ensure that the entrance of any germs is blocked.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4. Covering Up With The Crowns</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes if the teeth are damaged to a greater extent, the patient needs a crown to protect the filled pulp. The teeth become more fragile and sensitive if the height does not preserve the pulp, so adding the crown is the most crucial step that should not be missed to save the root canal and your teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Final Thoughts</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The whole process is carried out in only two visits. The initial tests are taken in the first visit before starting the treatment to give the time to heal your already existing diseases. After getting your root canal treatment done, you may be advised to re-visit the clinic to ensure the proper functioning of your RCT.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>\u00a0today to learn more about the root canal procedure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/root-canals-causes-problems-and-treatments/">Root Canals \u2013 Causes, Problems, and Treatments</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>*Neither this nor any other content in this media is meant to prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fWe\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

Several reasons cause this discoloration. Many drinks such as coffee and hot drink cause these stains. Similarly, tobacco also leaves yellow marks on the teeth. Experiencing an oral injury can cause stains on the teeth. Other than that, certain antibiotics also play a role in teeth yellowing. The outer layer of the teeth, called the enamel, also becomes weak with time and eventually wears off, and the inner layer is exposed, which is yellow. So, teeth Whitening can restore the original color of your teeth, and you can smile with confidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="1-people-suitable-for-teeth-whitening">1.

Broken teeth result from childhood injuries or accidents, which result in crooked teeth, which make people more self-conscious when speaking and smiling. Dentures are the optimal remedy for missing teeth that are still healthy. We want to highlight the scenarios in which you should get dentures in this post.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="when-there-is-a-wide-space-between-teeth">When There Is A Wide Space Between Teeth</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the space between your teeth increases, it may result in bone loss. Periodontal disease is considered the "silent killer" by dentists because you are unaware of what is happening to your teeth on the surface. While everything may appear fine and dandy on the surface, you may have numerous underlying concerns. Your teeth could be extracted, and there will be the need for support to other teeth, which can be provided only by dentures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="when-you-have-missing-teeth">When You Have Missing Teeth</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have already lost a tooth, you must take care of the remaining teeth to prevent further harm. When one tooth is lost, the other begins to deteriorate faster. According to a 2010 survey, 17% of persons over 65 lost all of their teeth. You should schedule your dental appointments in advance to avoid this happening to you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="when-you-are-suffering-from-tooth-decay-or-chronic-toothaches">When You Are Suffering From Tooth Decay Or Chronic Toothaches</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An intense toothache is the first indicator of tooth decay. Additionally, it targets the nerve in the center of the tooth. When you start visiting your dentist early on, the cavity may be filled without causing further damage. This step is far easier than waiting until it becomes significantly severe, and it is also cost-effective. When a severely decayed tooth is diagnosed, it should be removed and replaced with partial dentures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="when-you-have-swollen-inflamed-sensitive-or-bleeding-gums">When You Have Swollen, Inflamed, Sensitive, Or Bleeding Gums</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your inflamed gums are an indication of developing periodontal conditions. The leading cause of tooth loss is gum disease. Gums start receding when you have a periodontal infection. Severity can lead to the teeth falling off from the gums. Gum diseases damage both gums and teeth, but dentures are the cure to both. Whether you are getting complete dentures or half, you will get the gums attached to the artificial teeth covering infectious gums and preventing further infection spread.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dentures are the best and most cost-effective alternative if you have a decaying, crooked, or missing tooth.

        '<p style="text-align: center;"></p>\nGreetings from Procopio Towle Dental Office!\n\nAs many of you are still working remotely from home, getting ready for cooler weather, making upcoming holiday plans and more, you may not be thinking about your available or unused dental insurance benefits. Whether you have insurance benefits remaining or if you have funds set aside in a flexible spending account (FSA) or healthcare saving account (HSA), now might be a good time to schedule treatment so your patient portion amount can be applied to this year\u2019s deductions. Please check that you have used all available benefits to complete any outstanding treatment or for all-important preventive dental hygiene appointment (\u201ccheckup and cleaning\u201d). Most plans do not allow rollover unused dollars to the next benefit year and have a\u00a0<em><strong>\u201cUse \u2018Em or Lose \u2018Em!\u201d</strong></em>\u00a0approach - now is the time to get it done!\n\nWe still have a few available appointments!! Please <a href="tel:925-933-5677">contact</a> our office today to schedule your appointment as we find that the upcoming holiday season is one of our busiest periods.\n\nOur selected Saturdays for the rest of this year are\u00a0<em><strong>November 13, 2021 and December 11, 2021.</strong></em>\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our office.\n\nBest Regards,\nDr. Procopio',

        "If you have a toothache, it is important to figure out what is at the root of your discomfort. From there, you can determine how to best relieve any pain, swelling, or other symptoms. If your symptoms persist for more than a day or two, see one of our dentists. We can provide guidance on how to relieve your symptoms and prevent future pain. We strongly recommend that you talk to one of our dentists before using any of the following remedies if you\u2019re pregnant, breastfeeding, or have any medical condition that may be impacted by herbal ingredients.\n<h3><em>Recommendations:</em></h3>\nFor many people, a <em><strong>saltwater rinse</strong></em> is an effective first-line treatment. Salt water is a natural disinfectant, and it can help loosen food particles and debris that may be stuck in between your teeth. Treating a toothache with salt water can also help\u00a0reduce inflammation and heal any oral wounds. A regular saltwater rinse and cold compress application can typically remedy minor irritation, but more serious toothaches may require one of our dentist\u2019s interventions. <em>Mix\u00a01/2 teaspoon (tsp) of salt into a glass of warm water and use it as a mouthwash.</em>\n\nA\u00a0<strong><em>hydrogen peroxide rinse</em></strong> may also help to relieve pain and inflammation.\u00a0Make sure you properly dilute the hydrogen peroxide. <em>To do this, mix 3 percent hydrogen peroxide with equal parts water and use it as a mouthwash. Don\u2019t swallow it.</em>\n\n<em><strong>Peppermint tea bags</strong></em> can be used to numb pain and sooth sensitive gums. <em>To do this, allow a used tea bag to cool down before applying it to the affected area.</em> It should still be slightly warm.\n\nFor thousands of years,\u00a0<em><strong>garlic</strong></em> has been recognized and used for its medicinal properties. Not only can it\u00a0kill harmful bacteria that cause dental plaque, but it can also act as a pain reliever. <em>To use this, crush a garlic clove to create a paste and apply it to the affected area. You may wish to add a tiny bit of salt. Alternatively, you can slowly chew a clove of fresh garlic.</em> Clove has been used to treat toothaches throughout history, because the oil can effectively numb pain and reduce\u00a0Inflammation. It contains eugenol, which is a natural antiseptic.\n\nIf your toothache is severe or is the result of a more serious medical condition, you need to see one of our dentists so you can treat it properly. Many toothaches will require medical attention. An over-the-counter pain reliever such as Advil or ibuprofen\u00a0could help until you see one of our dentists.\n\nYou should also see your dentist if you experience any of the following symptoms:\n<ul>\n \t<li><em>fever</em></li>\n \t<li><em>trouble breathing or swallowing</em></li>\n \t<li><em>general pain that lasts more than one or two days</em></li>\n \t<li><em>swelling</em></li>\n \t<li><em>pain when you bite</em></li>\n \t<li><em>abnormally red gums</em></li>\n \t<li><em>foul-tasting discharge, or pus</em></li>\n</ul>",

        "<h4><em><strong>Do you have anxiety attacks right before going to the dentist?</strong></em></h4>\nHaving an open dialogue with one of our dentists can help you. Our professional team members at Procopio Towle Dental Office understand that people are nervous or have phobias about being at the dental office because we have helped other people like you. Bring your music and headphones for your appointment. Music is especially useful if one of your specific anxiety triggers is the sound of the dental office. You may need to listen for directions from one of our team members, so keep the volume at a reasonable level. There are also some great meditation apps where you can learn how to put yourself into a more relaxed state. The great thing about this is that it can help you with more than just your dental anxiety. This visualization technique can seem overly simple, but sometimes simplicity is just what you need. Just close your eyes and imagine the one place in the world that makes you feel the most at ease. Imagine the park, the beach at sunset, or another scene in your mind and pretend you are there.\n<h4><strong>Alternative Options - Nitrous Oxide \u201cLaughing gas\u201d or Diazepam (Valium)</strong></h4>\nWhen being open with one of our dentists, listening to music, visualization, or mediation does not help your dental anxiety; it\u2019s time to consider nitrous oxide, \u201claughing gas\u201d, or ask for a prescription of Valium. Often, you will be relaxed enough that we can provide you with the necessary treatments, and we can accomplish more in one appointment to prevent having to prolong how long the full treatment plan will take. It can be easier to know that you will have a comfortable and one significant appointment rather than several smaller appointments.",

        'CEREC crowns are a new and innovative type of dentistry that has taken the industry by storm over the past decade. We strive for the most conservative, accurate and biocompatible dentistry possible - oh and did we mention that they can be created in a single appointment.\n\nWant to know more about these innovative dental procedures, here is our ultimate frequently asked questions for CEREC crowns...\n<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What are CEREC Crowns?\u00a0</strong></span></h2>\n<strong><u>C</u></strong>hairside <strong><u>E</u></strong>conomical <strong><u>R</u></strong>estoration of <strong><u>E</u></strong>sthetic <strong><u>C</u></strong>eramic Crowns - also known as <strong>CEREC</strong> crowns - are an innovative dental procedure that combines technology and skill to create a crown in a matter of one appointment. Utilizing <strong><u>C</u></strong>omputer <strong><u>A</u></strong>ided <strong><u>D</u></strong>esign/<strong><u>C</u></strong>omputer <strong><u>A</u></strong>ided <strong><u>M</u></strong>anufacturing technology, also known as <strong>CAD/CAM</strong> dentistry, this new field of dentistry has provided optimal function and esthetics in order to create natural teeth for patients.\n\nThe procedure involves your dentist taking a 3-Dimensional (3D) digital impression of your mouth to measure the area where the crown will be placed - say goodbye to traditional impression material. Afterwards, a small camera is utilized to take high quality images of your teeth. Once finalized, the milling unit is used to create the ceramic crown. The dentist will then paint and glaze each tooth to match your other teeth perfectly. Bonding is the final stage of the procedure, which can be completed in a matter of minutes - creating a high quality and meticulously shaped crown that fits seamlessly with the rest of your teeth.\n<h2><strong>How long do CEREC Crowns last?</strong></h2>\nBoth types of crowns typically last 10-15 years. However, the lifespan of a crown largely depends on the patient\u2019s oral hygiene. Take good care of your mouth and crown and it can last much longer than 15 years.\n<h2><strong>Are CEREC Crowns more expensive?</strong></h2>\nAs with any dental procedure, your costs will vary.\n\nThe cost can be based on a number of factors, these include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The type of dental insurance you have.</li>\n \t<li>Procedures covered by your dental insurance.</li>\n</ul>\nProcopio Towle Dental Office accepts all PPO insurance programs, as long as they will allow you as a patient to choose any dentist to be your primary dental care provider without any obligation to see one of their dentists within their network.\n\nWe also provide an \u201cin-house\u201d Procopio Towle Annual Dental Membership for patients who are without dental insurance, it is a prepaid membership dental savings plan that delivers additional value by eliminating monthly premiums and deductibles. For new patients and current patients who do not have dental insurance, it provides an economical way to get dental comfort care they otherwise could not afford.\n<h2><strong>Are CEREC Crowns better than traditional Crowns?</strong></h2>\nCEREC crowns are more conservative on the tooth and more time efficient. Given that they only take a day to complete, these technologically advanced crowns, have become the preferred option.\n\nWhile it can take weeks to receive a traditional dental crown, a CEREC crown is created in a single appointment. Not only that, but they allow for a better bite and more natural teeth for patients. Rather than using an impression tray and material, which is uncomfortable and subject to minor distortion, we take photos of the tooth using a digital camera. The computer will create a 3D model of the tooth that is designed by your dentist as opposed to a Lab Technician, who is unfamiliar with your mouth. Once the tooth design is finalized, our milling machine will fabricate the crown from a ceramic block with exceptional accuracy, achieving both great fit and esthetics. They look extremely realistic and you do not have to wear a temporary crown or have uncomfortable impressions of your mouth taken.\n<h2><strong>Are CEREC Crowns good for molars?\u00a0</strong></h2>\nThe simple answer is YES!\n\nMolars typically do much of the hard work when breaking down food substances, making them susceptible to wear and tear. Consequently, a high-quality CEREC crown is always a good option for these types of teeth, if restorative options are needed. Obviously, these types of crowns work on any tooth and your dentist will provide the best option for you during consultation.\n\nMoreover, CEREC restorations are less reactive than gold and other metals. Therefore, patients are less likely to suffer from irritation, making it a safer choice.\n<h2><strong>Conclusion\u00a0</strong></h2>\nOverall, CEREC crowns are an innovative and highly efficient dental procedure that provides all the existing benefits of crowns and more!\n\nIf you are considering CEREC crowns or are still looking for options, call Procopio Towle Dental Office today, where we will be happy to help answer any inquiries you may have.',

        "As we know, respiratory infections increase this time of the year and COVID-19 further exacerbates and complicates \u201cflu season\u201d. Individuals with lower immune systems are more susceptible to these infections. The standard advice for the prevention of these illnesses is to wash your hands and keep your immune system healthy by eating properly and exercising regularly. Prevention advice for COVID-19 further includes six feet or more of social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and always wearing a face covering when around others. Although these practices are good ways of keeping hundreds of different bacteria and viruses from getting into your system, one lesser publicized approach to healthy living and avoiding a respiratory infection is to keep your teeth clean.\n\nPeriodontal (gum) disease is caused by plaque producing bacteria. The body releases what are called \u201ccytokines\u201d in order to defend itself against any type of infections such as periodontal infections. These cytokines trigger your body to constantly fight or defend themselves, thus weakening the body\u2019s immune system while fighting other infections. Symptoms of periodontal infection are often not noticeable until the disease is advanced. Some of the symptoms include bad breath that will not go away, red or swollen gums, tender or bleeding gums, loose teeth, or sensitive teeth. The American Academy of Periodontology has reported that, <em>\u201cBacteria that grow in the oral cavity can be aspirated into the lung to cause respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, especially in people with periodontal disease.\u201d</em> The bacteria that are multiplying in the mouth are not only being used as viral factories but are also being breathed into the lungs. Studies have shown that 85% of the population have some degree of periodontal disease and therefore it is extremely important to get regular dental checkups. A dentist can diagnose periodontal disease in the early stages during routine teeth checkups, prior to individuals realizing that they even have it. That is one of the reasons professional cleanings at a dental office are recommended every six months.\n\nSusceptible lung exposure is not the only part of your health that is connected to your oral health. It just so happens that this is a focus given these unprecedented times we are living in due to the attention being given to the COVID-19 pandemic. If left unchecked, poor oral health leading to increased bacteria in your mouth can also impact many other different systems in the body and be a factor in heart disease, dementia, and diabetic complications.\n\nBased on the health benefits of preventive dental care, we at Procopio Towle Dental Office in Walnut Creek dental office would like you to consider making your next appointment for your dental checkup and teeth cleaning. We are trying our best to do everything we can to be proactive in making sure you receive the dental care you need especially when there are known benefits to simple daily dental hygiene, routine teeth cleanings, and periodontal diagnosis by your dentist. We are also proud that due to our strict guidelines and protocols when visiting our dental office, no one in our office including patients, staff, hygienists, dental assistants, and doctors, has been infected or tested positive for COVID-19.\u00a0 Please consider making your next appointment now and every 6-months thereafter as another aspect to being as healthy as you can be.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Tiziana Procopio",

The best candidates for Invisalign are those with mild to moderate misalignment of the bite and dental arch that can easily be addressed with this treatment.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The consultation will also cover the overall cost of the dental procedure, as well as outlining any insurance coverage if required.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Creates an Invisalign Plan\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have all agreed that Invisalign treatment is a desirable option for you and your teeth, we take x-rays, photographs and impressions of your mouth. We will take </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">polyvinyl siloxane (PVS)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impressions and these record molds can be sent to the aligner tray laboratory, who then fabricate a series of aligners for the entire treatment. These are designed to fit precisely over the dental arch to straighten your teeth. Once <a href="https://pwdds.com/invisalign/">Invisalign</a> laboratories have utilized computers to create 3-D renderings of your teeth, this information is stored within our own dental office computers.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be a back and forth process between the office and laboratory regarding Invisalign adjustments until we are completely satisfied with the trays to then start the overall procedure. Perfection is key to much of our work.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Wait for your Aligners\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the tray aligners, it may take a month or so for them to be properly sculpted to fit your mouth. After that, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">each aligner tray is worn for approximately two weeks during which the next tray in the series is used. This sequence of trays may be anywhere from 8 trays to 48 trays, depending on the severity of the misalignment and the compliance by patients.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Wear Your Aligners\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Patients will come to our dental office in Walnut Creek when the aligners are ready, and we will give them to you. They are all different and are meant to be worn in a specific order. As aforementioned, each aligner should be used for two weeks.\u00a0 The number of aligners that you\u2019ll need will depend on how complex your treatment plan is. Usually, you\u2019ll have one aligner for every two weeks of treatment. It\u2019s imperative that you wear your retainers between 20 and 22 hours every day.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As your treatment progresses, each new aligner will serve to bring your teeth into straighter positions. You can take out an aligner to eat or brush, but otherwise, you should basically always be wearing one during the treatment process. If you don\u2019t, your teeth movements won\u2019t progress according to plan, and as you put in new aligners, they won\u2019t fit correctly.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Invisalign Refinements</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the last of your Invisalign trays have been worn for two weeks, you may have completed the whole teeth aligning process. Although, more often than not, a few teeth might still need some minor adjustments to create the perfect smile. Our dental specialists here at Procopio Towle Dental Office will inspect your teeth to assess the overall results. In some cases, we may create a few more \u201crefinement\u201d trays, if required.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Invisalign Retainers\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your treatment is complete you\u2019ll be given</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> removable retainers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before you stop wearing your Invisalign braces we\u2019ll fit a discreet fixed retainer behind your teeth, which will permanently hold them in place. At the same time, we\u2019ll take impressions for a removable retainer, which will arrive back from our lab the following week. Your removable retainer will be very similar to your Invisalign aligners, but you will only need to wear it periodically at night.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that\u2019s it\u2026</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s a fairly straightforward, no-nonsense dental procedure that can bring amazing results, in a short and simple time frame.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>For more information, call Procopio Towle Dental Office<a href="tel:9259335677"> (925) 933-5677</a>, today to find out how we can help create the perfect smile for you.\u00a0</b>',

        '<b>What is Invisalign?\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign is a revolutionary system of the science of orthodontics to create clear plastic aligner trays to gently reposition teeth in a discreet yet affordable manner. Clear aligner trays are becoming one of the most popular ways to straighten your teeth. Dr. Jasmine Jenkins, our Invisalign Specialist, is excited to offer this treatment to teenagers and adults at Procopio Towle Dental Office.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide further insight into these highly popular and extremely effective dental services, we have compiled a list of the top 5 facts you NEED to know about Invisalign.\u00a0</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b> They are Removable</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional fixed and wired braces, Invisalign are removable. This allows you to take them off when you eat and/or drink. This removable element means that Invisalign does not interfere with your daily life, as you can enjoy all your favorite foods without worrying about anything getting stuck in your wires or brackets. This also means that your teeth will be cleaned and maintained effectively - in some cases more so than braces - as you can brush your teeth without having to maneuver around the metal brackets.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The removable aligners ensures you can adopt the best oral hygiene practices when not in use. Simply remove the aligner, use clear soap, and brush them in cold water. By rinsing thoroughly you will be able to remove any excess dirt accumulated throughout the day.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign is also perfect for people who play contact sports, especially those that require mouth guards. Simply remove the aligners while playing and replace them when you\u2019re done.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This adds convenience for many adults. There are no changes to your diet that need to be made while you are going through treatment. This is one of the main reasons why this style of aligners are recommended.</span>\n<ol start="2">\n \t<li><b> You Do Not Need a Specialist to Adjust Them</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With traditional braces, an Orthodontist will set appointments for you to come in and have the wires tightened and adjusted. However, with these clear aligners, you will have a short visit with our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign Specialist</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to check the progress of the aligners given to you and will simply give you the next 1-2 trays of aligners.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign aligners are virtually invisible, include no metal and are custom made for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teeth. They work in a series of trays that gradually shift your teeth into place. Each tray is manufactured so that the teeth are slightly straighter than the previous tray. Your teeth will typically move up to 0.25 mm per tray. Every two weeks, you will receive a new set, slowly moving your teeth towards their ideal positions.\u00a0</span>\n<ol start="3">\n \t<li><b> Invisalign is comfortable (more so than braces in some cases)</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients who opt for Invisalign articulate how comfortably they are in their mouth. Without the metal wire and just a removable, fitted thermoplastic aligner, patients find that Invisalign is a comfortable oral option that provides ultimate ease of use. There are no brackets that can create sores, which alleviates any mouth ulcers or cuts forming in your gums.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this increased level of comfort, Invisalign tends to be a popular choice among many adults. And with only 35% of adults\' front teeth aligned correctly, it\u2019s a no-brainer.</span>\n<ol start="4">\n \t<li><b> You have to wear them 22 Hours a Day\u00a0</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign must be worn a minimum of 22 hours per day. Typically, you are only supposed to remove them for eating and practicing daily oral hygiene. That means that if you are heading out for a date or going to a party, you will have to wear them! But remember, they are completely clear - so they often go undetected.\u00a0</span>\n<ol start="5">\n \t<li><b> Even our very own Dr. Procopio has had Invisalign\u00a0</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the phrase \u2018practice what you preach\u2019 definitely holds true here at Procopio Towle Dental Office. This year Dr. Procopio decided to receive Invisalign treatment by our very own specialists here in Walnut Creek. The results? A huge success. S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he loves how aligned her teeth have become, with minimal effort and pain. With the dentist and advanced technology doing all the hard work - all she had to do was wear her very own tray every two weeks for a perfect smile.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">All aligners are integral for the health and overall appearance of your teeth and thankfully here at Procopio Towle Dental Office, we provide a range of treatments that will provide you with a beautiful smile.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision for </span><a href="https://www.brightnow.com/orthodontist/invisalign"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over metal braces really comes down to you, the patient. Each patient\u2019s needs and preferences are unique and special. If the appearance of metal braces has been holding you back from a straighter smile, Invisalign could be a great option. This is especially true for teens that are perhaps self-conscious of wearing braces, or adults that need them later in life. Invisalign is often used for adults who didn\u2019t maintain their smile with a retainer when they had braces as a teen, or never got the chance to straighten their teeth to begin with.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are ready to achieve a beautiful, attractive smile, contact Procopio Towle Dental Office to </span><a href="tel:925-933-5677"><b>schedule a consultation</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visit with Dr. Jasmine Jenkins can work with you to determine if you are an appropriate candidate for treatment with Invisalign and can help get you started obtaining the smile you\u2019ve always wanted!</span>',

        '<h2><b>How to Manage Dentist Anxiety in Children</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dentist Anxiety in Children</strong> - Dental fear and anxiety (DFA) is one of the major challenges in pediatric dentistry [1]. The prevalence i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ndeed, it is extremely common for children to be fearful or stressed when they have to visit the dentist. This pervasive problem can lead to deliberate avoidance of dental treatment, thereby having a negative effect on the child\u2019s orofacial and psychological health in the long-run.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, we have devised a list of top tips for managing children\'s dental anxiety, to help alleviate any psychological issues your child may be experiencing, with the overall aim of creating a positive experience for both you and your children when they visit their local dental practice.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Be Open and Honest With Your Kids</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the saying goes, \u2018honesty is the best policy\u2019. It is advantageous to be as honest with your children about dental procedures so that they are never caught off guard. It\u2019s natural to be fearful of the unknown, particularly when someone is pointing sharp equipment towards your mouth, so having full clarity about what is happening is key to resolving any emotional distress your child may be experiencing.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means then is when your children ask about the dentist, avoid illusive answers that will create an air of mystery (children can typically sense this). This may inadvertently have a negative impact on the way they approach the dentist, which may trickle into their adulthood; posing serious oral implications later on in life. Instead, reiterate the importance of regular dental check-ups and the benefit of seeking professional help for all their dental care needs!\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Try to Understand What Is Triggering Your Child\u2019s Fears</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad experiences in a dental practice will likely cultivate extreme Dentist Anxiety in Children. One of the best ways to combat these issues is to establish what exactly is triggering your child\u2019s fear. The most common issues are listed below;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Embarrassment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some children\u2019s oral health may have some glaringly obvious issues that are visible, such as tooth decay or dental deformities located at the front of their mouth. Such dental issues may strike fear of embarrassment amongst children; particularly if they have been susceptible to bullying as a result of this. Consequently, reassuring your children that the dental clinics are professionals who have seen a wide array of oral issues (many worse than the ones your child has), is a fruitful way of calming down their initial insecurities and will hopefully encourage them to be more relaxed.\u00a0</span>\n\n<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Top tip</strong>: Try to find a dental professional who will continue to communicate with your child during the procedure to help comfort them along the way.</span></em>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Needles or Injections.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trypanophobia is defined as an extreme fear of medical procedures involving injections or needles. According to a study reported by the US National Library of Medicine, up to 50 percent of children exhibit needle fear</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, knowing there is some pain associated with needles can be very scary for kids - particularly when it\'s within your mouth. However, if your child avoids needles or injections from a young age, this fear is likely to persist within their adult life - rendering long-term problems like avoiding the dentist (despite that persistent pain they are experiencing in their molars).</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The keynote to take about here is that dentists are professionals who know how to make an injection as painless as possible (I mean they did get a degree doing it). It\u2019s their job and so they have full experience and expertise within this matter.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oftentimes, it\u2019s best to keep the needle out of sight by asking the child to close their eyes before the injection is administered. Computerized injections are also a great option because they don\u2019t look like a traditional needle and can control the speed and pressure of the shot.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Anesthesia.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0Some patients are uncomfortable with the idea of being put to sleep and not being aware of what\u2019s going on while they\u2019re under. Others don\u2019t like having a mask on their face. The best approach is to be informative and explain exactly what the patient can expect. Taking it slow and sharing the details of the procedure ahead of time can go a long way in calming the patient. If the stress is severe, dentists should always opt to reschedule the procedure rather than forcing a child, which may amplify the fear even more.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing about painful experiences from other children or adults who\u2019ve had similar dental procedures, it\u2019s hard to not expect the same. However, most dental professionals are dedicated to making young patients as comfortable and confident as possible. Pain management is taken very seriously and, as always, everything should be explained to your kids, so they know what to expect before any procedure is started.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a clearer idea of what kind of fear your child is experiencing and what is triggering those particular feelings, it should be easier to address them and ease their anxiety.</span>\n\n<b>Find the Right Dentist for Your Child</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad experiences at the dentist can prompt Dentist Anxiety in your Children. In fact, studies taken place in the U.K revealed a clear correlation between negative interaction made by dental staff members and your children and their subsequent dental anxiety levels. This means that staff and dentists working within the practice have a very direct effect on the child\'s mental well being. Thus, the friendlier the receptionists and encouraging dental professionals, the better the child\'s overall experience at the dentist will be.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, it\u2019s essential to find the right dentist for your family\u2019s needs. Opting for a pediatric dentist or family dentistry is a fruitful way of preventing dental anxiety amongst your children. In order to do this, it would be advantageous to inquire as to what methods the dental practice use to help calm nerves and make every appointment a more positive experience. To help, here on some tips on how to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose the best dental plan for your family</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Practice, our patients are everything to us.\u00a0 Our aim is to provide a welcoming and inviting atmosphere for every patient who enters our practice, and helps them leave with a big, bright smile!\u00a0</span>',

        '<h1><b>Festive Foods: The Do\u2019s and Don\u2019t this Holiday Season\u00a0</b></h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christmas is right around the corner\u2026</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">That\u2019s right, it\'s that time of year again where we start celebrating. Typically, Christmas is synonymous with festive foods, drinks, friends, family, and of course, presents. However, given the current circumstances, a socially distanced celebration will likely be the reality for most of us this year.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, we may overcompensate for the \u201cunusual\u201d festive period this year. As lockdown restrictions inhibit non-distanced socializing, excess Christmas decorations and overindulging in food is the most likely scenario for homes all across the nation. While we embrace this with open arms given the year we\u2019ve had, it\'s important that we are mindful of our dental health over the holidays. Some foods that we eat over Christmas have great nutritional value, but some are terrible perpetrators for plaque. In this article, we will discuss the good and bad types of festive food and drinks, to help you make conscious decisions about your oral health.\u00a0</span>\n<h2><b>What food are BAD for your oral health\u00a0</b></h2>\n<b>Chocolate and Sweets\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know Christmas would not be Christmas without candy. It\u2019s almost impossible to think about the festive season without chocolate and sweets. However, their overall effect on your oral health is extremely damaging, should you choose to consume excessive amounts on a continuous basis.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chocolate and sweets both contain high volumes of sugar; the tooth\'s biggest enemy. Typically, both of these food substances deliver high doses of sugar into the mouth, which cultivates bacterial growth, plaque, and gum disease. Bacteria in the mouth turns sugar into acids, which eats away at the surface of your teeth, rendering decay and cavities over time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We acknowledge that chocolate is such a HUGE part of Christmas, so we\u2019re not saying to completely refrain from eating ANY chocolates. However, be cautious when consuming such products to avoid unwanted trips to the dentist in the new year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes our mouths between 20 minutes and 2 hours to re-balance the decay-causing acids which are produced by eating sugars; therefore, grazing on sweet treats keeps the teeth under constant attack.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Tip: if you\u2019re going to eat chocolate, keep consumption to a minimum as opposed to continued binging over the holidays. If you are going to eat any, then it may be best to do it after a meal, when your teeth are already being challenged with acids from your normal diet. Afterward, Brush for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste to help protect the teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Toffees / Candy\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of food products are a dentists worst nightmare. It\'s sugar, sticky and hard. Indeed, their texture makes them one of the most damaging desserts to your teeth. Their hard exterior can render a cracked or chipped tooth, unless you softly suck away at the sweetie for a prolonged period of time until it reduces in size. However, this still has a drastic impact on your oral health, as the longer your teeth are exposed to the candy, the more sugar and acid available to attack your tooth\u2019s enamel. Again, keep consumption to a minimum for healthy teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Dried Fruit</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dried fruit features in a lot of our festive food products such as mince pies, Christmas cake and Christmas pudding. All of this may seem like a healthier option, given that it is of course \u2018fruit\u2019. Contrary to popular beliefs, however, these types of food products are extremely high in sugar. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sugar content high in these foods, but these sweets can also get stuck in between your teeth or even cause damage to dental appliances or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth fillings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u00a0</span>\n<h2><b>What Foods and Drinks are GOOD for you</b></h2>\n<b>Cheese\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may not be the best for the waistline, but it is for your teeth?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For all those cheese lovers out there, you will be happy to know that cheese is great for your teeth. The high calcium content in most cheese products ensures that your teeth will remain strong and healthy. There\u2019s also studies that stipulate eating cheese after a meal is a great way to neutralize the acidity levels in your mouth, so get your cheese boards out this festive season.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Milk\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to that of cheese, milk comes packed with calcium and has a neutral acidity level. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking milk makes your teeth stronger and protects tooth enamel. It also strengthens your jaw bone, which can help you keep your natural teeth longer, and fights tooth decay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Almonds\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuts, especially almonds, are a good option for your teeth. They are a great choice for snacking because they are high in protein and calcium but low in fat and sugar. Make sure you choose the natural kind and not the sugared or honey-roasted as you snack this festive season.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Practice, we care about your teeth. We understand that you may want to indulge in some delicious and rich food products, but make sure that you think about the overall welfare of your teeth during the holidays. No one wants to have to check-in at the dentist in the new year for some fillings, sealants, dentures or crowns as a result of sugary snacks.\u00a0</span>\n<h2></h2>',

        '<h1><b>Top 3 Benefits of a Local Dentist near you</b></h1>\n<h3><b>Looking for a local dentist near you?\u00a0</b></h3>\n<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your teeth have a huge impact on both your physical and mental health.\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, over 80% of Americans [1] don\u2019t like the way their teeth look. This dislike of their teeth gives these people lower self-esteem, which can lead to a lower quality of life [2].\u00a0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why regular visits to the dentist\u2019s office should be a top priority. And if you want the best care possible, a local dentist is a fruitful way of receiving top-quality dental treatments on your doorstep. In order to shed further light on this, we have compiled a list of the 3 MAJOR benefits that a local dentist can offer.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h2><b>A Local Dentist Builds Personal Relationships</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that dental service organizations and corporate or chain dentistry are in a growth phase. Most of them are based on a low-fee, high-volume model. They generally accept all of the reduced-fee plans in their areas. Many of the doctors do not have an ownership stake in these offices, which leads to more turnover, meaning patients may not see the same doctor from one visit to the next. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, they have to treat several patients at the same time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some patients do not mind these types of dental systems, many individuals really struggle to find this type of model sustainable. One of their main concerns is the dentist\'s inability to get to know them on a personal level. It can be terrifying enough to have scary machinery inserted in your mouth; particularly so if the person who\u2019s doing it is a complete stranger.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, this structure necessitates a large turnover of patients daily, leaving you susceptible to rushed treatment, which may render an erroneous diagnosis, or hurried poor-quality dental care.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the majority of cases, this doesn\u2019t happen with local dentists.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local dentists function differently from those corporate models. Whether big or small inside, the dentists are part of the community and often take the time to build a personal relationship with you. - well that\u2019s what we do here in Walnut Creek. This helps us understand your oral health needs so we can recommend the best treatment for you (and your budget).\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This personable and intimate local relationship enables </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">each member of your family to feel comfortable with the care being provided to them. This makes it easier to express any concerns that may arise in the future. Plus, it makes it easier for your kids to visit the dentist. They won\u2019t be afraid of the dentist. You\u2019ll trust that they are in good hands and they won\u2019t feel any sort of panic when they hop into the dental chair.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h2><b>Top Quality Dental Treatment</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local dentists tend to provide a higher quality of oral care.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, they care about you. For us, dental treatment is about more than making a living. It\u2019s about keeping your teeth healthy and your smile confident. On top of that, local dentists have a reputation to uphold. Over 85% of local businesses get a large portion of their customers through word of mouth. That means local dentists are more motivated to ensure you have a good experience with them.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it\u2019s going the extra mile to get to know you and your family, or recommending the most affordable but highly effective dental treatments - local dentists care about YOU and your teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we like to ensure you\u2019re completely comfortable every time you sit down in the dentist\u2019s chair. Whether you\u2019re receiving dental implants in walnut creek, top quality cosmetic treatments, or just a standard check-up procedure, we take the time to explain every step of the process so you know what to expect. Our dentists are in no hurry to get you in and out as quickly as possible. Instead, high quality is an integral asset to our dental clinic - which often necessitates time and meticulous attention to detail with each patient to ensure a seamless procedure.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have the majority of all dental treatments and procedures in-house, for both adults and children, meaning you can come to one key location in Walnut Creek to receive top-quality dental care.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h2><b>Patient Reviews You Can Trust</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you schedule a first appointment with any dentist, it\u2019s a good idea to ask them for referrals. These referrals will be able to tell you what type of experience they had with the dentist.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And when it comes to a local dentist, these referrals are easy to find and even easier to trust.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They are the people in your community. You probably know many of them already. They could be your acquaintances, your friends, and even your family. This ensures you can trust your dentist to take care of your teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If it\u2019s not word of mouth, a great source of information is online on the likes of Google, where you will have access to a range of reviews from patients who have received local dental services. At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we keep our online referrals updated by our clients and respond to all the comments to provide comprehensive insight into how our practice functions. It is of the utmost importance for both our customers to voice their experience with our dentists, as well as us to see their feedback - whether it\u2019s positive or negative.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For any dental procedure here in Walnut Creek, call our office today to book in with one of our specialists. We are here to help make your smile as beautiful as possible.\u00a0</span>\n<h2></h2>',

        '<h2><b>\u201cTo chew or not to chew, that is the question?\u201d</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it was the Northern Europeans chewing birch bark tar 9,000 years ago to satisfy their mouths and provide some much needed medicinal tooth relief, or the Maya civilization chomping on sapodilla trees to quench their thirst and/or hunger. Chewing gum has stood the test of time and has been a stable part of human life, distracting the jaw and curating bone movement in the mouth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, like most things in life, not all chewing gum was created equally. While western civilization has moved far away from utilizing leaves as gum, nowadays, there are clear distinctions between the good kinds and bad kinds for our teeth.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some may seem self-explanatory, but you would be surprised by how many people don\u2019t even realize the negative implications caused by excessive chomping on those soft, cohesive substances that are so addictive and tasty!\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide further insight into this common dilemma, we have provided some \u2018extra\u2019 tips on what chewing is good, bad, and terrible for your teeth. Our blog discusses what types of chewy condiments you should avoid, and which ones are fine to consume; leaving your mouth in \u2018mint\u2019 condition.\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b>THE BAD KIND OF CHEWING GUM\u00a0</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, the bad type of chewing gum is the one that contains sugar.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, non-sugar free chewing gum contains sucrose. Sucrose and other fermentable carbohydrates can be metabolized by oral bacteria. The problem with this type of gum is that they can produce substances such as dental biofilm (a type of fungi in the mouth) and acid, which can lead to enamel erosion and cavities. The negative effects of these types of chewing gum is entirely dependent upon how much chewing gum is consumed and how long for, as well as the sequence of consumption. For example, chewing sugar-containing gum before eating food that reduces acid production will be less damaging than the reverse.\u00a0</span>\n\n<img class="wp-image-4382 aligncenter" src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chewingum-1-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="333" />\n<h3><b>THE GOOD KIND OF CHEWING GUM</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is compelling evidence to suggest that sugary chewing gum cultivates the onset of bacteria and cavities in your mouth, the opposite can be said for sugar-free chewing gum.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugarless gum has been shown to have an array of oral health benefits that can prevent tooth decay. Studies have shown that chewing sugar-free gum after meals and snacks can help remove and/or neutralize the acids released by bacteria in plaque (a harmful and extremely damaging substance to most tooth enamel). The act of chewing gum stimulates the salivary glands in your mouth. Saliva neutralizes and washes away the acids in your mouth that are produced by broken down foods. By washing away this acid, you are protecting your enamel. So when you chew gum after a meal, you\u2019re helping propagate the acid-cleaning saliva that plays an important part in your oral health</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is predicted that the average unstimulated salivary flow rate for healthy people is 0.3-0.4 mL/min. When chewing unflavored gum, you stimulate the salivary flow rate by 10-12 times that of the unstimulated rate. Flavors also act as salivary stimulants. The stimulated salivary flow rate is significantly greater while chewing sweetened and flavored gum as opposed to unsweetened, unflavored chewing gum base.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulated saliva flow provides protection against dental erosion via several mechanisms. Saliva buffers the effects of acids in foods or drinks that could otherwise soften teeth\u2019s enamel surface, and swallowing excess saliva created by stimulation clears acid. While unstimulated saliva does not have a strong buffering capacity against acid, stimulated saliva has higher concentrations of total protein, sodium, total calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate and therefore has a higher buffering capacity. Additionally, saliva contributes proteins to dental surfaces and helps to carry more phosphorus and calcium around your mouth, creating an acquired enamel pellicle that protects against dental erosion.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We would also advise that if you do chew gum, opt for s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ugar-free gum sweetened with xylitol, which has the added benefit of inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus mutans, one of the oral bacteria that cause cavities.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we would advise that you refrain from eating lots of chewing gum on a continuous basis. Indeed, excessive chewing gum can sometimes lead to wider health problems in general. For example, excess chomping - typically in times of high stress- can lead to temporomandibular joint dysfunction. This symptom can greatly affect the jaw, jaw joint and surrounding muscles leading to severe pain any time you attempt to move your jaw away from its typical alignment.\u00a0</span>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><b>To Chew or Not to Chew?\u00a0</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand it can be a habit to pick up a piece of gum and start chewing. In most cases, it feels completely innocent. But there are some negative associations with sugary chewing gums that are filled with additives that will stimulate bacteria in your mouth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although chewing sugar-free gum can be beneficial in most instances, there are some cases in which chewing gum is not recommended. For example, if you are experiencing any type of jaw pain or temporomandibular disorder symptoms (TMD/TMJ), you should refrain from chewing gum and talk to your dentist about what options are available to you.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our professional opinion, it is completely fine to chew gum. However, this is entirely dependent upon the type of gum you choose.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugarless gum is strongly advised, particularly after you\u2019ve eaten. In fact, even the American dental association recommends chewing gum after your meal to reduce plaque and increase saliva flow around your mouth - fighting off bacteria and tooth decay. However, avoid sugary chewing gums that will coat your teeth with sucrose and lead to the erosion of tooth enamel, causing cavities and erosion over time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on dental hygiene and top tips from our experts, call one of our friendly staff today. We are more than happy to provide insight into what foods are GOOD for your teeth, as well as ones that should be avoided</span>',

        '<h1>5 simple tricks to scare cavities away during Halloween</h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween is right around the corner, an event that is associated with copious amounts of candy and additives that are renowned for their ability to cause tooth decay.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, we are NOT here to tell you to refrain from eating these sugary condiments that bring much joy and happiness for many kids; an asset that is desperately needed during these rather unprecedented times. However, we are here to provide advice on how to alleviate the negative oral effects prototypical of excessive candy consumption!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand this year\u2019s Halloween will be very different from previous years. Shelter in place across California (and the US in general), has meant that children can\u2019t go out and get bucket-full of candy from neighbors. But, this does have an advantage for your children\'s oral health. When purchasing your own candy to compensate for the shelter-in-place, you can be in charge of what your children eat, and you also have the ability to teach them very important oral tips that will be indispensable in later life.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To shed light on this, we have compiled a list of top tips for combatting candy during this Halloween, that will help scare cavities away while still allowing you to enjoy those mouthwatering goodies.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><b>1) Don\u2019t deprive your kids of candy</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rule number 1. Do not deprive your children of eating candy. I know we should probably not be saying this as dentists, but this short-term cavity combative measure could lead to more serious problems in the future. Deprival can send the wrong message entirely and make them crave those sugary foods more in the future. They may even sneak a few when there\u2019s no one watching! -</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, it may be a fruitful idea to get your children to pick their top 10 (or however many you decide) of their favorite snacks. The remaining candy you have can be hidden away or donated to a food bank. They may want to pick hard sweets, soft sweets, chocolate, and even pretzels as their Halloween treats! This is a useful lesson to showcase to them that there is an array of snacks that are bad for their oral hygiene, not just excessive sugary candy.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Allowing children to pick their favorite snacks will teach them that \u2018candy is not bad\u2019, but as the saying goes \u2018everything in moderation\u2019. Too much will lead to cavities, but having a few snacks here and there, particularly during Halloween, is completely fine!&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><b>2) Choose Candy Wisely</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite allowing children to pick the snacks they want out of their goodie bags (refer to point 1), as a parent, you still have the ability to choose which candy you can provide to your children. Unlike your usual assortment of Halloween candy bags, COVID-19 has immersed us all into this unique environment where we can pick and purchase the candy for our children. So choose wisely!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all candies are created equal. On a scale of worst to best, gummies, lollipops, and caramels are by far the most damaging to children\u2019s teeth. This is because the frequency of exposure is more harmful in most cases than quantity. Lollipops and gummies are high in glucose and last for prolonged periods of time on your teeth. The sugar will wear down the enamel on your teeth and the frequency of exposure increases the chance of harm. If presenting your children with any of these types of sweets, make sure they brush their teeth after finishing them to remove any plaque deposits.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Better treats are typically chocolate, the best of which is dark chocolate, whose cocoa beans are known for their antibacterial compounds that can fight bacteria in the mouth.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><b>3)&nbsp; Set a Treat Time&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be a fruitful idea to set a treat time during the Halloween period. This could be a schedule that lasts beyond Halloween and thus teaches your kids some valuable lessons:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaches children that excess candy consumption is not tolerated and moderation is essential for oral and general health</span></li>\n \t<li>Makes kids less inclined to snack throughout the day if they have a dedicated time to consume goodies</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>4) Set up a brushing schedule</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what time it is, it is crucial to brush your children\u2019s teeth after they have been eating candy.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some foods and drinks, particularly those high in carbohydrates and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sugars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can stimulate the growth of oral bacteria that attack your tooth enamel. By brushing your teeth after you eat, you reduce this bacteria and help protect your enamel from damage.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluoride </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mouth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rinses for kids also help prevent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decay, according to the American Dental Association.</span>\n<h3><b>5) Drink water and limit other sugars.&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next few weeks (or months even with Christmas on the horizon), candy is going to become a frequent sighting in many homes across America. For this reason, we would also recommend increasing the amount of water your children consume and reducing the number of sugars they have in other foods - particularly sugary drinks. Water has the benefit of washing away leftover food and residue that cavity-causing bacteria love to eat. It prevents bacteria from deteriorating your teeth - maintaining good oral health for your children.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that\u2019s it. There are our fang-tastic tips for combatting scary Halloween cavities that are likely to ensure if you don\u2019t adhere to good oral hygiene practices.</span>',

        '<h1>All You Need To Know About CEREC Crown</h1>\n<h3><b>What are same day crowns?&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">CEREC crowns are a dental restorations that can be completed within the same day! This means, you can simply walk into the practice with your teeth and walk out with a brand-new and healthy crown!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, just because they are completed quickly, at Procopio Towle Dental Office, we do not compromise on quality. The same-day crowns are the same as our usual crown procedures, but they\u2019re ready in a couple of hours as opposed to a few weeks!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a useful procedure for all our patients, as it mitigates any inconvenience caused by multiple trips to the dentist - saving you time and money. It\u2019s also fruitful in our current climate, with COVID-19 causing much fear amongst those at large to leave their homes and risk infection. Only one trip to the dentist can make you feel slightly more relaxed!&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>How are CEREC Crowns Placed?&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To start the CEREC crown procedures, we take an examination on your mouth to determine whether this procedure is the best option for you. Once you and the dentist have reached a conclusion about whether the CEREC crowns are suitable for you, we will start preparing the tooth, taking a scan, milling the crown and fitting it - all completed within the space of a couple of hours.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional crowns, which comprise 3 main materials; porcelain, metal and porcelain fused to metal, single day crowns are made of ceramic. Utilizing innovation CAD-CAM technology, our dentists ensure that we achieve the perfect fit with your new crowns, making them look as natural as possible.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of a computer, we can create a digital 3D image of your tooth and crown with precise measurements, mirroring that of your typical tooth/ crown procedures. Once the final design is complete, a milling machine carves a replica of the design to make a crown out of a single ceramic block. The milling process takes approximately 15-20 minutes and another 10 minutes to glaze, heat and polish the CEREC crown. Afterwards, the CEREC crown will be cemented and if required, a dentist will make minor adjustments for the perfect fit.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process, your teeth may need to be numbed and contoured in order to fit the crowns. However, we will work closely with you and address any concerns you may have regarding local anesthetic. Gentle dentistry is our specialty here at Procopio Towle Dental Office.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Advantages of CEREC Crowns</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of benefits associated with same-day crown dental procedures. These include;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-effective: You no longer need to book several appointments and wait a few weeks to see a dentist (potentially longer given the current COVID-19 crisis). You can have a new crown sculpted and contoured within a few hours!&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost-effective: You can save money on appointment costs and take less time off work&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comfortable: these dental procedures are as comfortable as your usual crowns, and you do not need an impression to have one rendered</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoring your looks quickly: as you have a perfect smile back within a few hours</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoids the need for temporary crowns which are renowned for their uncomfortable nature and inability to stick to the mouth. Preventing decay: dislodged temporary crowns may make room for decay&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoring functionality immediately: teeth alter your speech, smile and eating patterns. Same day crowns restore all these functions instantaneously.</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;',

        '<h1><b>What Is The Importance of Regular Teeth Cleaning?</b></h1>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">With COVID-19 stopping all but emergency dentist appointments, your regular oral hygiene checks came to a halt!</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, it is&nbsp;<strong>now&nbsp;</strong>the right time to get your teeth cleaned.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dentists are not just for keeping your teeth bright; they have a direct and significant impact on your general health. Bad oral hygiene has been linked to serious, and in some cases, life threatening diseases such as strokes and cancer (for more information visit the&nbsp;importance&nbsp;of regular checkups blog).</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">While maintaining good dental hygiene (brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing) is&nbsp;important, having an expert to inspect your teeth can help in numerous ways. In fact, your teeth may look and feel healthy, but there may be underlying issues that only a dentist can detect. Regular dental checkups and cleaning procedures can mitigate any problems you may have, or just provide that additional reassurance that your teeth are healthy.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">To provide further insight into teeth cleaning benefits, here are a list of reasons why professional cleaning is essential. These include:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Prevent gum disease</strong></h3>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Regular teeth cleanings can help prevent the onset of periodontal disease, an inflammation of the gums, typically caused as a result of poor brushing and flossing habits.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">As our mouths are full of bacteria, along with mucus and other oral particles, plaque can form on the teeth. Subsequently, brushing and flossing daily can help prevent plaque from forming on tooth enamel. However, plaque that is not removed can harden and form tartar. Only a professional cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist can remove this from forming on the teeth.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, a dentist can examine your gums when cleaning your teeth and detect any signs of inflammation. They may use a tiny ruler called a probe to check for and measure any pockets around the teeth, with a healthy mouth containing a pocket depth of around 1 to 3 millimeters. Without seeking professional cleaning, tartar and plague could go undetected, resulting in gum disease, which can lead to complications.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Removes stains that dull or discolor teeth&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your smile is&nbsp;important. In fact, it is the first thing someone notices when they speak to you. Consequently, having discolored or stained teeth can severely affect your confidence, preventing you from showing them off in social situations.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">A dentist can restore that confidence and provide you with a cleaner smile. They do this in a safe and cautious manner, unlike home whitening remedies which may damage your teeth and harm tooth enamel.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>They are covered</strong></h3>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many dental plans cover regular cleanings as it is in the insurers\u2019 interests for their patients to have their oral health looked after, to prevent future expensive dental treatments.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although, even without dental insurance, a professional clean is not an expensive procedure, particularly in comparison to other cosmetic treatments. You will also benefit in the long run from both a financial and health perspective by receiving cleaning treatments. Here at Procopio Towle Dental Office, we offer our annual <em>In-House Dental Membership</em>, for those who do not have dental insurance. Our&nbsp;<em>In-House Dental Membership&nbsp;</em>is a prepaid membership dental savings plan. Click here to for more details on our&nbsp;<em>In-House Dental Membership.</em></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a patient\'s oral health will differ from one another. Factors such as genetics, diets and lifestyle play a fundamental role in the overall well-being of your teeth. A dentist or a hygienist can provide you with a personalized plan on how to maintain good oral habits after the procedure, so that you can have a healthier and brighter smile for a prolonged period of time.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Procopio Towle Dental Office at <a href="tel:(925) 933-5677">(925) 933-5677</a>.</strong></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>',

Your dentist will help you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> choose the type of denture that works best for you based on whether you are needing a small or larger proportion of your teeth replaced.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Full denture:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A full denture is placed over your mouth after remaining teeth are removed and tissues have healed.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Partial Denture:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A partial denture rests on a metal framework that attaches to your natural teeth, serving as an anchor for the dentures.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>The Denture Procedural Process:\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">How does the denture process work?\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Consultation\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process starts with a consultation, where your dentist will examine your bone structure, gum tissues and existing teeth. They may also take an X-ray of your mouth to determine what type of dentures you need, whether partial or full.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dentist will then take an impression of your mouth as well as measurements of your facial contours and features of your mouth too.</span>\n\n<b>Initial Fitting\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the impressions have been complete, the dentures are then made. During the initial fitting you will get the opportunity for the dentures to be set in a wax base and then inserted in your mouth to examine how the dentures fit and their overall aesthetic.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you and the dentist have approved the overall design, they can be fitted into their final acrylic base to make them look as naturalistic as possible.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Final Fitting\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the final fitting, the dentist will analyze the overall fit of the dentures in your mouth and their comfort with the additional acrylic base. This is the opportunity for you to retest the comfort of the dentures and decide whether any adjustments need to be made. It must be noted that the dentures will feel strange at first and may take some time to get used to.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>How long do dentures last?\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, the lifespan of dentures is around 5-7 years. These cosmetic procedures will need to be remade and relined due to normal wear over a period of time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your dentures will also need to be rebased, which involves a dentist creating a new base, whilst still keeping the existing dentures within your mouth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you age, your mouth naturally changes, causing the dentures to loosen, making chewing difficult and irritating to your gums. It is therefore imperative that you visit your dentists for regular check ups to ensure your teeth are in a healthy and hygienic condition, to safeguard you from any possible irregularities with these cosmetic procedures.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Top Tips for caring for your dentures</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visiting the dentist is integral for the overall maintenance of <a href="https://pwdds.com/dentures/">dentures</a>, however there are also a range of things you can do to keep your dentures in the best possible condition. These include;\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing over a towel or basin of water when handling dentures. They can be extremely delicate and may break if dropped.\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your dentures moisturized at all times. You can do this by placing them in a cleanser soaking solution or in water when you\u2019re not wearing them. However, never use hot water - this can warp the dentures making them unusable.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brushing your dentures daily. This will remove food products and plaque - maintaining an overall clean and healthy aesthetic.\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brushing your gums, tongue and plate every morning too. This will stimulate circulation in your tissues and help remove plaque.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information regarding our denture procedures, visit our <a href="https://pwdds.com/dentures/">dentures pages</a> or alternatively call Procopio Towle Dental Office at <a href="tel:9259335677">(925) 933-5677</a>. </span>',

        '<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last <a href="https://pwdds.com/benefits-of-dental-implants/">Dental Implant</a> blog post, we discussed the benefits associated with this dental procedure and their ability to improve facial structure, food habits, overall dental health - and of course their natural and long-lasting oral effect.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it can be an extremely daunting process to go through a dental procedure for many patients. In fact, it is estimated that nearly <a href="https://www.gentledental-mi.com/overcoming-dentophobia-a-fear-of-the-dentist/">75% of adults in the United States</a> experience some amount of fear with regards to visiting a dentist. Of that percentage, about 5%-10% of those people have a strong enough fear to be considered sufferers of dental phobia.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, understanding how the dental implant process </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">works </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is of paramount importance for many patients. In order to provide further insight, we have provided an overview of the <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-implants/">Dental Implant</a> process.</span>\n<h2><b>Overview of Dental Implants</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly is dental implant surgery?&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental implant surgery is a procedure in which a dentist replaces your tooth roots with artificial ones.&nbsp; Dental implants are typically a comfortable alternative to dentures or bridgeworks which are renowned for their uncomfortable nature.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">How dental implant surgery is performed is highly dependent upon the type of implant that is required and it is different for each individual patient. Factors such as the condition of your jawbone can mean you have to have several procedures in order to get the implants fitted (more info in section 2)</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As dental implants provide a solid support for your teeth - a major benefit of the procedure - their process requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant. Due to this, the process can take several months to complete.&nbsp;</span>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Stage</b></td>\n<td><b>Duration</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consultation and Treatment Plan</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to a weeks to Schedule&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extractions</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks on average and up to 10 days healing</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone Grafting</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Might take up to a few weeks to schedule and can include up to 12 months of healing&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implant placement</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of hours&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osseointegration</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> months for your lower jawbone and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> months for your upper jawbone&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healing Collar</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 days</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abutment Placement</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 weeks of healing</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temporary Crown</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 weeks while the permanent one is being made</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Tooth&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 dental visits</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-Procedure</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few days to heal, check up weeks after the final procedure&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><b>Consultation and Treatment Plan&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to getting a dental implant is a consultation. This process may involve an X-ray and/or teeth impressions.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your medical history is likely to be reviewed at this point to highlight whether you have any underlying health problems which could pose a risk during your surgery.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this is complete, a treatment plan can be devised. You will be informed about what is going to happen during each step of the way and how you should prepare for the Implants procedure.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Associated Procedures&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may need to receive additional procedures in the process of getting dental implants. The most common is bone grafting and tooth extractions.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you still have a tooth where the implant is due to be inserted, then an extraction will be required. This is a fairly simple procedure taking no more than 30 minutes to complete.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also need bone grafting which is a more complex process. This procedure involves thickening the jawbone if it is too thin or soft to support implants. The procedure involves sourcing the bone tissue from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a tissue bank that prepares bone from a cadaver. The graft does not have cells and works as a scaffold allowing the patient\u2019s bone to regrow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This process can take anywhere between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4-6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> months, which means your implant can only be inserted after this period.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Dental Implant Surgery&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the dental implant surgery itself, the dentist will normally use a local injection</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to numb your mouth and ensure the process is as pain-free as possible.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step will involve a dentist making a small incision within your mouth, to enable the metal implant to be inserted in the appropriate position.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Osseointegration</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the surgery is complete, the next stage of the dental implant procedure is known as osseointegration. </span>\n\nOsseointegration refers to the process of the bond between the physical bone and the surface of the artificial tooth replacement - the dental implant.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This process can take on average anywhere between 3 to 6 months.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this stage passes, you will receive a healing collar - which is basically a piece of metal that prevents your gums from growing over the implant. These remain on your teeth for a 2 week period.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Abutment Placement&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step of the implant process is abutment placement. Abutments have the main benefit of cultivating gum healing around the implant and are usually made of titanium or zirconia.&nbsp; These dental connectors can be applied at the same time or after the implant placement procedure. You will be advised on when this will occur during your consultation.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Dental Implant Procedure</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The final stage of the dental implant procedure involves the placing of the crown or bridge. Once your gums have fully healed, the dentist will insert a naturally looking prosthetic tooth in your gum to create a natural and seamless finish.</span>\n\nDr. Procopio is a specialist in Dental Implants and has extensive knowledge and experience of these specific procedures. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of Implants are also now more affordable. </span>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Our single implant procedure price cost ranges between $3,000-$6,000. I</em><em>f you have insurance, we will have to verify, if implant is a covered benefit.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<i>Call Procopio Towle Dental Office and schedule your Free Implant Consultation and Complimentary X-Rays.</i>',

        '<h1>Fillings and Sealants: What\'s the difference?</h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings/">Dental fillings</a> and <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-sealant-benefits-causes-and-side-effects/">dental sealants</a> are two entirely different procedures. While they are both quick cosmetic treatments (take less than half an hour, on average) and both seem to coat or shield the teeth, their materials, purpose, and longevity differ in a number of ways. To make the process clearer, here is a list of the major differences between the two. </span>\n<h2><b>Restorative Versus Preventive</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of dental sealants and fillings are one of the major distinctions between the two cosmetic treatments. Fillings are considered a restorative application used on teeth that have been damaged by decay. When a dentist gives you a filling, they will remove the decayed material, clean the affected area and then fill the cleaned out cavity with filling material (for more information, visit our dental fillings blog here). Sealants, on the other hand, are deemed \u2018preventative\u2019. A sealant will be used by a dentist to cover a portion of a tooth to prevent damage from occurring. </span>\n<h3>Dental Fillings</h3>\nA dentist will use a filling to restore a tooth after a cavity or a hole has formed in your mouth from tooth decay.\n\nTooth decay is usually a result of dental plaque which turns sugar into acid. Subsequently, the oral acids in your mouth dissolve the minerals which make up the enamel, such as calcium. This will cause the enamel to weaken, usually evident through discolouration of the tooth, whereby holes or cavities will form in the material.\n\nA filling is therefore inserted into the tooth to prevent any additional damage, with its sole purpose to block the entry of oral bacteria that could result in an infection or even greater decay to the affected tooth. For more information, review our <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings/">dental fillings blog</a>.\n<h3>Dental Sealants</h3>\nConversely, sealants are deemed as a \'preventative\' dental procedure.\n\nIndeed, a sealant can be applied to a tooth which has not suffered any decay. Sealants essentially prevent tooth decay from forming on the pits and fissures of the teeth, providing a physical barricade to protect the natural tooths surfaces and grooves - the perfecting breeding ground for decay to form. Thus, dental sealants shield teeth from the early onset of decay before its too late.\n<h3>Permanent Vs Temporary</h3>\nAnother distinction between the two dental procedures is their longevity. Whilst both sealants and fillings are considered permanent treatments, it is fillings that usually last longer. Sealants, on the other hand, are regarded as temporary dental procedures - which is why they are often used on children!\n<h3>Dental Fillings</h3>\nOn average, dental fillings usually last around 10-15 years. A filling replacement is a fairly rare procedure, as the materials are durable and withstand food supplements and bite resistance.\n<h3>Dental Sealants</h3>\nDental sealants can usually last up t0 10 years without needing a replacement fitted. However, regular check-ups are required to ensure the materials have not chipped or worn away. Although, these dental procedures can be easily replaced by a hygienist who can add more sealant material if required.\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information about dental fillings and sealants, contact Procopio Towle Dental Office at <a href="tel:9259335677">(925) 933-5677</a> to schedule a Consultation or visit our <a href="https://pwdds.com/services/">dental services page</a>.</span>',

        '<h2>Dental Fillings</h2>\nDental Fillings are one of the most popular dental procedures to have. In fact, it is stipulated that the average American will get fillings at <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160927143042.htm">least 3 times</a> in heir lifetime.\n\n<strong>So what are they?</strong>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings-procedures-in-walnut-creek/">Dental Fillings</a> are a restorative treatment that repairs the damage of tooth decay. Dentists \u201cfill the hole\u201d that has been created by the decay. The decay is removed prior to the actual placement of material. Fillings are made from a composite (tooth-colored) material or amalgam (silver) material. Composite is the newer and preferred material due to cosmetic reasons. An anesthetic gel is applied to the area where an injection of local anesthetic is given. The injection then numbs the tooth so the patient does not feel any discomfort during treatment. The dentist then removes any previous dental restoration and the surrounding decay. The cavity is cleaned prior to the material being applied. Similar to the sealant process, the material is hardened using an ultraviolet light. After the material has hardened, the bite is adjusted and corrected using a handpiece.</p>\n\n<h3>Benefits of Dental Fillings</h3>\n<b><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings-procedures-in-walnut-creek/">Dental filling</a> treatments provide a number of benefits, including;\u00a0</b>\n\n<b>Quick procedure: <span style="font-weight: 400;">When only one tooth is affected by decay, the filling treatment is a quick and uncomplicated process that roughly lasts about an hour-long</span></b>\n\n<b>Durable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental fillings can last on average around five-seven years on average - particularly tooth-colored fillings. White silver fillings usually have a longer life span and can last for around 12 years (on the premise that you maintain good oral hygiene)</span>\n\n<b>Cost-effective: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental fillings are a fairly economical dental procedure - particularly if you are covered by dental insurance.</span>\n\n<b>Appearance: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, dental fillings are a fairly undetected dental treatment - particularly if you opt for a tooth-colored filling restoration!</span></b>\n<h3>Dental Fillings risks and side effects</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Side effects posed by the implementation of a filling are fairly few and far between. However, as with any treatment, patients may experience side effects. These include;\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Sensitivity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some patients may experience sensitivity prior to receiving a filling around the infected area. If you are experiencing sensitivity, it is advisable that you avoid hot or cold drinks during this time to mitigate any pain.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Pain:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some patients may also detect pain when biting down or applying pressure to the treated tooth the following days after the procedure.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Re-treatment:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> As the dentists permanently remove damaged areas of your natural teeth and fill it in with a synthetic material, you will have to return to the dentist five-twelve years after the first procedure.\u00a0</span></b>\n<h3>How are Dental Sealants and Dental Fillings Different?</h3>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Although they are similarly performed, they are very different. The main differences come from the goals of the treatments, longevity, and the amount of modification to the actual tooth. The average life of a filling can be expected to last as long as ten years. The average life expectancy of a sealant is no longer than a year. Depending on the patient\u2019s oral hygiene practices, it may not even survive that long. Sealants are typically provided to children to protect their back teeth from developing decay, whereas fillings can be provided throughout one\u2019s lifetime to restore a tooth from decay that has already formed. During a filling, unlike a sealant, the natural tooth structure is modified due to the removal of the decay. A sealant only fills in the natural grooves of the tooth.</p>\nTo find out more about our dental procedures and services, visit <a href="https://pwdds.com/services/">our dental services</a> page now!',

        '<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal is a term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the root canal which is where the tooth\u2019s nerves reside.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Procopio Towel Dental Office, our experienced dentists are specialists in saving your natural teeth using advanced technologies to treat you quickly and comfortably.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Step-By-Step Process of Root Canal Treatment</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A root canal treatment is used to repair and save an infected or decaying tooth. During the root canal procedure, a dentist will remove the nerve and pulp, afterwards cleaning the inside of the tooth. Once the cleaning process is complete, the tooth will then be sealed to begin the healing process.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin the root canal treatment, our endodontist will numb the infected or damaged tooth using local anesthesia&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will then insert a small shield to isolate the tooth - keeping it clean and dry</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An opening is then made through the crown of the tooth and into the chamber&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fluid is put into the canals to kill any bacteria and to rinse out debris&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, the pulp is removed. Utilizing small instruments, our endodontist carefully cleans and shapes the canals&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After space has been appropriately manipulated, the endodontist fills and seals the root canals. A temporary filling is often incorporated to protect the outer layer of your tooth and allow it to heal from the infection</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If necessary, you must return to your dentist to have your tooth properly restored with a filling or crown to protect the tooth for any future infections&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Signs that warrant a return trip to the dentist</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Common symptoms and signs associations with root canal infections include;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Pain or discomfort - <span style="font-weight: 400;">ranging from mild tenderness to unbearable pain, especially when you apply pressure from eating or pressing on the tooth, or expose the tooth to extreme temperatures (i.e., consuming cold or hot drinks)</span></b></li>\n \t<li>Red, warm or swollen tissues <span style="font-weight: 400;">near or surrounding the tooth, especially the gums. In some cases, swelling can also affect your face and neck too.</span></li>\n \t<li><b>Tenderness or discomfort in swollen tissues,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially when you touch or apply pressure to it.</span></li>\n \t<li><b>A bad taste in your mouth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a bad smell permeating from your breath caused from the infected tissues&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>What causes root canal infections after treatment?&nbsp;</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons why a tooth can have an infection after a root canal. These include:&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shape of your root canals can be very complicated and areas of infection may go undetected in the first procedure</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tooth could have narrow or curved canals that weren\u2019t fully cleaned and disinfected during the root canal&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tooth may also have additional accessory canals that could be housing bacteria which may reinfect a tooth&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the placement of the crown or permanent restoration is delayed following treatment, it could allow harmful bacteria back into your tooth&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tooth may get a new cavity after treatment, or become cracked or damaged, leading to a new root canal infection&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits of Root Canal Treatment</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many clinical reasons for needing root canal treatment, but there are also countless practical reasons as to why saving your natural tooth is a beneficial choice for your overall dental wellbeing. Endodontic treatment helps you maintain your natural smile whilst continuing to enjoy the foods you love the most. With professional care, root canal treatments can also last a lifetime. The main benefits associated with root canal treatment, i</span>t stops the spread of infection to neighboring teeth.\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major benefits associated with root canal treatment is its ability to prevent the spread of infection within the mouth. As outlined in the treatment section, root canal procedures involve the removal of bacteria from the tooth. Once the bacteria is removed, the tooth is often cleaned and disinfected to prevent toothache or decay. After the infected tooth has been treated, there is no room for the bacteria to spread, ultimately safeguarding you from multiple dental trips and costly repairs to your teeth.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Root canal treatment has a naturalistic result&nbsp;</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal therapy involves the treatment of the tooth pulp or nerve and finishing it with a </span><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings-procedures-in-walnut-creek/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crown or a dental filling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The treated tooth is sealed with a tooth-colored filling or crown that provides a new and beautiful appearance.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we provide quality root canal treatment that restores both the functionality and the aesthetic of your teeth.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>It prevents the jawbone to degenerate</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal treatment also has the ability to preserve teeth. Because of this, you are able to avoid the degeneration of your jawbone - a damaging side effect associated with the loss of a tooth or teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bones are strengthened by a physical stimulus. For your jawbone, that includes the force exerted on your jaws by chewing and biting and the way those forces travel through your teeth. When a tooth is missing, the bone loses its stimulus in that spot and your body begins signaling osteoclasts to break down the jawbone. New bones are still being formed, but at a lower rate than bone that is being destroyed. Consequently, fixing the decay or infection during a root canal treatment and preserving the tooth facilitates the continuation of movement in your mouth - ultimately stimulating the bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>It enhances oral and overall health&nbsp;</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe tooth decay can greatly affect the overall oral health of an individual and pose greater health implications beyond the mouth. It is widely regarded that tooth decay can cultivate the early onset of heart diseases, diabetes, and respiratory infections - which in some cases can result in death (for more information check out our blog on gum disease and the importance of routine checkups).&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Virtually pain-free procedure&nbsp;</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal treatment is virtually a painless process and often leaves you with less discomfort during recovery than if you have your natural tooth extracted. Our dentists here at Procopio Towle Dental Office utilizes modern techniques, advanced technologies, and effective anesthesia to create a comfortable treatment.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Tips for preventing root canal infections</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several preventative steps that you can take to stop a root canal infection, which involves taking care of your teeth after the procedure:&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brush and floss at least twice a day&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a gentle, antiseptic mouthwash for the first few days after a root canal. Use it as often as you\u2019d like afterward, too&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use an over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen for soreness after treatment&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return to your dentist for a final crown or permanent restoration as soon as possible. This will seal the root canal from bacteria and protect your tooth</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get dental cleanings at least twice a year to keep your teeth generally healthy and catch decay or infection early&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See your dentist right away if you notice any early signs of infection&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>',

        '<h1><b>Dental Sealants</b></h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the regular routine check-ups, At Procopio Towle Dental Practice we offer a wide range of treatments and procedures for our patients. A particularly popular and common treatment we provide, especially amongst children, are dental sealants.</span>\n<h2><b>All About Dental Sealants&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental sealants are a preventative treatment applied to premolars and molars with deep crevices to protect against the development of decay.&nbsp; Deep pits and fissures are the source of over 80% of tooth cavities, which is primarily due to food and bacterial plaque lodged in between tight crevices on your teeth that are often inaccessible with brush bristles. Subsequently, plaque acids and enzymes at the base of these grooves cause the tooth enamel to dissolve, eventually rendering cavities in your mouth.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, many attempts to stop pit and fissure tooth decay have been made...&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fistulotomy (prophylactic odontology) is a particular procedure that aims to prevent the onset of tooth decay. This treatment involves funneling the grooves open with a cone-shaped dental tool.&nbsp; If done early enough on a groove that does not extend through the dentin layer, it may be possible to perform just this type of dental procedure. However,&nbsp; more often than not, the deepest pits and fissures do often extend beyond the dentin layer and this procedure must be followed by placement of a filling of some type.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The grooves can also be cleaned out less invasively with a micro abrasion handpiece, which sprays a stream of abrasive particles deep into the seams of the pits and fissures to remove plague bacteria and roughen the enamel surface. Although, as micro abrasion preparation doesn\u2019t completely eliminate plaque in the deep narrow crevices, it is usually followed by placement of a dental sealant.</span>\n<h2><b>How are Dental Sealants applied&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying dental sealants is a fairly simple and painless process. It only takes a few minutes for our dentist or hygienists to apply the sealant to seal each tooth. The application steps are as follows:&nbsp;</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, the affected tooth that requires a dental filling is cleaned thoroughly prior to manipulation&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tooth is then isolated from all mouth moisture and the grooves are etched with a mild acid solution. This produces a microscopically roughened surface into which the sealant will adhere.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teeth are then rinsed and dried</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sealant is then applied to the gloves as a viscous liquid, which hardens on its own or by exposure to a blue light.&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once placed, the sealant prevents bulk plaque from being able to accumulate in the pits and fissures.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Benefits of Dental Sealants&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many benefits to sealant treatment. Most often sealants are used in children, but adults with decay can benefit from sealants as well. Overall;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants protect the grooves of the teeth from food particles.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are easy to apply and are a quick treatment</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protection of teeth begins immediately after application.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants can last several years before a reapplication is needed.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are more affordable and are a proactive way to help prevent cavities.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are white or clear in color, making them virtually invisible when talking, smiling or eating.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are suitable for children too</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Side Effects of Dental Sealants&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants have some potential downsides. It is possible for micro leakage to occur along with the sealant - especially if moisture is present when the sealant is placed. If leakage does occur, it may be difficult to detect until a large cavity develops beneath the sealant.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It\'s important that patients are reminded that sealed teeth are not completely resistant to tooth decay. It\'s a big mistake to relax nutrition and oral hygiene standards on the belief that sealants alone will prevent cavities. Remember to see a dentist regularly to have the sealants evaluated for signs of failure. Left alone, a poorly contoured failing sealant is at least as prone to decay as an unsealed tooth.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Practice, our dentists </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are professionally skilled in performing a variety of dental filling and sealant services. Cosmetic dentistry is very personal and individualized for each patient. We understand that the appearance of your smile can have a dramatic impact on your confidence, image, overall appearance, relationships, and human interactions.</span>\n\n&nbsp;',

        '<h1>Dental Crowns: Procedures, Materials, and Implications</h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you missing a tooth? Or do you have problems with your existing dental restorations?&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well the chances are you have questions, and, with social distancing measures in place, you may be finding it difficult to get answers to the various queries and grievances you are currently facing. Indeed, with most dental practices only accepting those patients deemed \u2018dental emergencies\u2019, you may be putting various dental plans you had in mind to the bottom of your agenda. However, we want to remind you that this time in lockdown may in fact be a propitious time to plan ahead and be prepared for when restrictions are eased.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to help you with this, we have taken the liberty to provide you with further insight into one of our most popular dental procedures - <a href="https://pwdds.com/crowns-bridges/">dental crowns</a>; detailing what they are, how they function and why they are a prosperous and cost-effective dental service.</span>\n<h3>What is a Dental Crown?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A dental crown is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-shaped "cap" that is placed over a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cover the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to restore its shape and size, strength, and improve its appearance. A crown may be appropriate for a large area of decay or breakage when the remaining tooth structure is not sufficient to support a filling.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Why Is a Dental Crown Needed?</h3>\n<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://pwdds.com/crowns-bridges/">dental crown</a> may be needed in the following situations:</span></h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect a weak tooth (for instance, from decay) from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To restore an already </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broken tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a tooth that has been severely worn down.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there is not a lot of tooth left.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To hold a dental bridge in place.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cover misshapen or severely discolored teeth.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cover a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dental implant</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make a cosmetic modification.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restore Confidence and Self-Esteem.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Types of Dental Crowns</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold \u2013 A biocompatible noble metal. This is a good choice for molar restorations subjected to a great deal of bite force.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Metal crowns withstand biting and chewing forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down. Also, metal crowns rarely chip or break and are a particularly popular choice for out-of-sight molars. However, the metallic color and the costly replacement of gold&nbsp;is the main drawback for this particular type of dental crown.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stainless steel \u2013 These economical dental crowns are sometimes used on children\u2019s baby teeth.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stainless steel crowns are \u201cprefabricated crowns\u201d that are used and fused on permanent teeth covering the entire tooth and protecting it for further decay. However, stainless steel dental implants are typically utilized as a temporary measure. Its main purpose is to protect the tooth or filling whilst a dentist creates a specific dental crown made from a different material. The major benefit of stainless-steel dental crowns is that they are suitable for children - primarily due to the fact that they do not require multiple trips to the dentist and are thus a more cost-effective solution for dental health!&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porcelain \u2013 The most aesthetic option, a porcelain crown blends beautifully with natural teeth. This type may be made of solid ceramic, or porcelain fused to a metal core.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">All-ceramic or all-porcelain dental crowns provide better natural color match than any other crown type and may be more suitable for people with metal allergies. Porcelain dental crowns have the added benefit of matching your existing teeth (unlike metal crowns), to the extent that they are almost unrecognizable to the naked eye. Typically, these types of dental crowns are a good choice for teeth positioned in the front of the mouth, as well as long bridges where the metal is needed for strength. Although porcelain crowns do not contain metal, these types of dental crowns are vulnerable to additional wear and tear compared to other materials.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>What Problems Could Develop with Dental Crowns?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A problem that may develop with dental crowns often involves sensitivity immediately after the procedure has taken place and any anesthetics have worn off. If the tooth that has been crowned still has a nerve it in, you may experience some cold or heat sensitivity - in this case, we would advise you to veer away from hot or cold (fizzy drinks). We would also advise you to incorporate a toothpaste such as Sensodyne which contains potassium nitrate which aims to soothe the nerves inside your teeth from feeling pain from triggers. Although, all of these problems are fairly common and generally nothing to worry about. We would only advise you to seek further dental help if, when you bite down on your crown, you are experiencing discomfort. In the case, it is probably because the dental crown is too high on the tooth and will, therefore, need fixing by your dentist.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Can You Have an Allergic Reaction to Dental Crowns?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you can have an allergic reaction to dental crowns due to the mixture of metals utilized within the crown itself. However, this is extremely rare. As a dental practice, we go through extensive measures prior to any of our procedures to safeguard our patients from irregularities. Your health and safety is a priority to us.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that even if you do have metal allergies you are still able to have dental crowns, albeit those without metal fillings such as porcelain.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Does a Crowned Tooth Require Special Care?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always practice good oral hygiene and brush your teeth at least twice a day. Just because a tooth is crowned, it does not mean that the tooth is protected from decay or gum disease. We would advise you to floss your teeth as well -- particularly around the crown area where the gum meets the tooth.</span>\n<h3>How long do Dental Crowns Last?<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, dental crowns last between five to fifteen years. The lifespan of a crown depends on the amount of wear and tear the crown takes, how well you follow good oral hygiene practices and your personal mouth-related habits. By grinding your teeth or chomping on hard objects your Dental Crowns may be susceptible to chips.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>How Much Do Dental Crowns Cost?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs of crowns vary depending on what part of the country you live in and on the type of crown selected (for example, porcelain crowns are typically more expensive than gold crowns, which are typically more expensive than porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns). Generally, crowns can range in cost from $800.00 to $1,700.00 or more per crown. A portion of the cost of crowns is generally covered by insurance. To be certain, check with your dental insurance company.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we accept all PPO insurance programs, as long as they will allow you as a patient to choose any dentist to be your primary dental care provider without any obligation to see one of their dentists within their network. We also offer \u201cin-house\u201d Procopio Towle Annual Dental Membership for patients who are without dental insurance. Our prepaid dental membership savings plan that delivers additional value by eliminating monthly premiums and deductibles.

        '<h3>What is a Family Dentist?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A family dentist is a dentist that performs dental services for patients of all ages\u2014from toddlers to adults. Unlike some dentists that can perform pediatric services but prefer not to, family dentists regularly help both adults and children with their family dentistry needs. This extra practice makes them a preferable choice to a dentist that prefers adults but may work on kids if requested. So, from toddlers just getting their first tooth to senior citizens who might benefit from tooth replacement - a family dentist can assist with all types of oral services you and your family may require.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst registering with a family dentist provides a range of benefits for you and your family, we have outlined the top 4 benefits that you may have otherwise overlooked...</span>\n<h3>1)Track your family\'s Dental health</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically at family dentists, we can keep track of your family\u2019s dental as well as overall general health. Remaining at the same practice and forging a relationship with your dentist enables us to trace any genetic dental problems in your family and prevent them before they can cause any serious problems - meaning nothing can fall through the cracks when you are under the care of a family dentist. Consequently, combative methods can be put in place before it\'s too late!</span>\n<h3>2) Convenient and Comfortable Dental Services</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply, family dentists are convenient and comfortable. Instead of having to register each individual family member to different dentists, you can all be seen under the same roof. You can schedule appointments that enable all your family to be seen on the same day - saving you the time, effort, and money of making multiple trips.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the common dental anxiety many patients suffer from can be alleviated at a family dentistry. Generally, the close-knit, friendly environment generates a more relaxed and soothing scenario than your prototypical gloomy dental practice. If parents have also been going to a particular practice for years, you\u2019ll have a sense of familiarity and comfort with your dentist. Some dental procedures are painful as it is, so knowing your surroundings is an integral element to ensure a safe and seamless service.</span>\n<h3>3) All-round Dental Care</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our family dentists have vast experience in treating all sorts of dental problems. Again, family dentists will take care of all your dental requirements under one roof. Whether you are seeking teeth whitening services, dental implants or just routine check-ups, you and your family will be able to visit just one practice and leave smiling confidently and content.</span>\n<h3>4) Setting a good example for your children</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting an example and demonstrating to your children how important the dentist is for your general well-being and oral health is a major benefit of a family dentistry. If your family all attend different dentist practices, chances are your children will not see you sitting in a dental chair and having your teeth examined. Thus, family dentists naturally set a precedent for your children to take care of their teeth and seek dental care into their adult life.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Why Dr. Procopio\u2019s Dental Practice?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr Procopio strives to maintain good oral hygiene by welcoming you into a friendly, family atmosphere for all your dental requirements. Our family dentists perform the same services that adult and pediatric dentists perform including;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanings and checkups&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placement of fillings&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal therapy&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmetic Services and much more&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, family dentistry means bringing top-quality care to you and those you love in the Walnut Creek area, please call <a href="tel:9259335677">(925) 933-5677</a> or </span><a href="tel:9259335677"><b>click here to request an appointment</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>',

        "<em>Dr. Wolter shared a YouTube link with me years ago that he had posted which was filmed by him in the early sixties. It depicted the neighborhood around Newell Avenue, and Chris on what I think was a motor scooter. Over time I lost the link, and it would be great if anyone in his family or some acquaintance might have the link to share. Hope this helps, and I too miss him. ~Richard G.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Dear Dr. Procopio, Has it really been a year? Time goes by so quickly. I just want to compliment you on your beautifully written email regarding his passing. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with all of us who knew him and loved him. If you would like to post my thoughts, I would like to add:&nbsp;When&nbsp;Dr. Wolter was with you he&nbsp;had a way of&nbsp;making you feel like you were his most important patient. He was kind and gentle while taking care of your dental work&nbsp;and was always excited to show off his latest electronic gadget. I always had to clear my calendar for a hour or more when I saw him as he wanted to share stories about flying somewhere or show off aerial photos his took or talk&nbsp;baseball. A few Saturdays I came by and we listened to old games he had taped from years past.&nbsp;Dr. Wolter was my dentist for 30 years and I know he is truly missed by all of us who were lucky enough to know him and call him a friend as well. ~Annina P.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Wow\u2763\ufe0f What wonderful memories I have of Dr. Wolter on San Miguel Drive. &nbsp;A coworker referred me to him when I was working in Pleasant Hill. &nbsp;My memory fails me as to what year that was but it\u2019s been a very very long time ago. I\u2019m not sure how long he\u2019d been in practice but I immediately liked him. His girls were very small (probably just babies). He was a doting father. &nbsp;I followed him when he moved the practice to Olympic Boulevard. He introduced me to sealants. It\u2019s been 20+ (or more) years since I\u2019ve had a cavity. LOL.&nbsp;What impressed me so much about him was that he really loved the profession that he was in. He loved people. He also loved keeping up with the latest technology and wanted to pass that on to his patients. My after-cleaning visit with him was always so very special. We talked like old friends about whatever there was to talk about i.e., the Giants, flying and last place visited, my vacation and last place visited, newest dental procedure, etc. Every 4-5 months or so we just sort of picked up where we left off. Like good friends do. \u263a\ufe0fYes, he\u2019s deeply missed but never ever forgotten. ~Michele Y. S.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I became one of Dr. Wolter\u2019s patients in \u201895. I always looked forward to my visits because whether there to see Chris, one of the other dentists or just a routine cleaning, he and I would spend time talking about two of our in-common life interests, photography and flying. He also taught me a good deal about the art and science of dentistry. Sometimes we talked for a good deal of time, raising havoc with the office schedule as Dr. P, or another dentist, and an assistant would be waiting to perform a mundane procedure such as a crown or implant. Everyone happily waited while Chris and I talked about and showed off photos and told stories of flying, (I am not a pilot but have spent considerable time flying in all kinds of aircraft. In a previous life I was a photo journalist.) I did get to go flying with Chris, it was great. I was also impressed with the way he handled his illness, he spent time explaining to me the entire situation, how he was handling it all and with his usual good humor and realistic approach. I do miss my favorite DDS. I was in the office numerous times during the months leading up to his death but I was out of the country at the time of his services. Thank you for giving me a chance to share this.&nbsp; I recall sometime around 2004 - 2005, I had been having trouble with a molar, it became abscessed and was causing great pain resulting in a Saturday evening call to Chris moaning about a prescription. The result was me meeting Chris at the office early Sunday morning, just me, my wife, our Bichon Frise and Chris, more talk about all sorts of things...and a successful root canal. ~Best Regards,&nbsp;Milt S.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Hi Dr. Procopio-Towle. I\u2019ll remember Chris as passionate about his work, patients, flying, art, family, sports. One of the things I\u2019ll miss is the opportunity to attend a Oakland Raiders or A\u2019s game with him. We spoke about it, but could not get it together.&nbsp;He was proud of his Reggie Jackson MVP trophy that was pulled from a fire. He loved to show that off.&nbsp; We had good laughs about it. I\u2019m glad I have his Oakland Coliseum image in my office. Thank you for making that available to me.&nbsp;He loved deploying technology. Remember the patient goggles he had? I think you could watch news and videos. &nbsp;And, the 3D crown building machine. I\u2019m glad to have used them. We\u2019ve lost a local treasure. ~Thanks for doing this, Jordon B.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I was so sorry to hear of Dr. &nbsp;Wolter\u2019s &nbsp;passing.&nbsp; My husband and I had been patients of his for so many years.&nbsp; I had particularly difficult dental problems and he provided the most wonderful, caring direction and techniques to help me through some otherwise stressful times.&nbsp; I recall one evening many, &nbsp;many years ago, while we were leaving for a party on a Saturday night.&nbsp; A temporary tooth had come out.&nbsp; I called Dr. Wolter and he met me at his office and repaired the tooth; I never forgot his kindness.&nbsp; &nbsp;My husband as well enjoyed his friendship; my hubs took him to a 49er game that year.&nbsp; He was a very personable and caring man. ~Julianne B.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Dr. Wolter was a good person and a true professional. I enjoyed our conversations and it was always so apparent that he enjoyed flying. My true regret is that our talked about flight around Columbia, Ca never worked out because of our schedules. I do know that God will take care of him and that he\u2019s probably flying around in the clouds now. ~Roger H.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>He was such a kind man!&nbsp;I always felt like I was in good hands with him, he always made me feel good coming and going from his practice.&nbsp;He is missed and will never find another Dentist like him.&nbsp;He was a pioneer and great man.&nbsp;Rest In Peace \ud83d\ude4f ~Lauren L.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Drs. Procopio and Wolter,&nbsp;We truly appreciate your email and reminder though difficult to accept that a full year has passed since Dr. Wolter passed away.&nbsp;Where should I begin we lived just down the block on Olympic Blvd., close to Dr. Wolter's office in 1991 this is where our family started&nbsp;being patients/customers of his practice. To this day we remain patients/customers now of Dr. Procopio Wolter's dental office.&nbsp;&nbsp;We lived in the Peninsula San Mateo for a while and we would commute to his office for our dental treatments and check up annually.&nbsp;His office and staff always made it possible for us to have the time and day available to commute from the Peninsula to come over see him when we needed to be seen.&nbsp;There are so many stories of him and his kindness and graciousness towards our family I can only imagine to how many other patients&nbsp;he extended the same this is how he was caring, conservative and always with a positive and encouraging outlook on our dental issues&nbsp;or matters that we would have.&nbsp;There will never be another Dr. Wolter he was one of a kind human being we were very fortunate to known him and have had such a caring and kind dentist to take care of our dental needs for our family we were his patients for over 29 years.&nbsp;We look forward to Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle and her staff to continue to carry forward the dental practice that he built of quality dental&nbsp;services for everyone and carry on his legacy.&nbsp;Thank you for the opportunity to express some kind words about Dr. Wolter and the person that he was besides being a dentist to our family since I personally do not do Facebook. ~Alvaro S.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Dr. Procopio Towle,&nbsp;Thank you for the lovely remembrance of Dr. Wolter. He was my dentist for 30 years and always gave me the very best of care and excellence in all my dental needs. I still think of him fondly. ~Best, Kendall L.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Going back 40 years there are a lot of shared memories with Chris and our families doing things together, especially in the early 80's. Here is one that is less than 10 years old (I think)\u2026.&nbsp; Since I have known him (somewhere around 1980) Chris was always trying to keep in the forefront of technology and gadgets.&nbsp; I remember when he purchased one of his first drones with video camera attachment.&nbsp; He could not wait for me to finish getting my cleaning done so that we could go out into the parking lot, get the drone out of the trunk and get it up in the air. &nbsp;We probably flew that thing for 10 minutes, going over traffic and homes, using the camera to get a real \u201cbirds eye view\u201d of the neighborhood.&nbsp; He had an excitement that was infectious and really enjoyable to experience and share\ud83d\ude09 take care\u2026 ~Art H.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Hi Dr. Thanks for including my wife and I on your mailing list in remembrance of Dr. Walters. He became our family Dentist when my Family and I moved from upstate New York&nbsp;&nbsp;to California in 1984. We all looked forward to his kindness, honesty, and overall warm personality whenever we chatted with him during our dental appointments. I felt honored to have been his Father's replacement in the EBMUD Accounting Department when he retired from the Water Organization. We chatted and and laughed about \"how small\" the world can be at times in that I was now a patient for his Father's son. Thank you again for the remembrance reminder&nbsp; relative to this wonderful man. Hope You and your Dental Staff stay safe and healthy during this Pandemic COVID-19 time period. Love to you all! ~Paul and Phyllis R.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I first met Dr. Chris in 1976 when he started his dental practice at the his Ridgecrest office in Walnut Creek CA on San Miguel. We were both 27 years old. We loved Chris so much as he cared for me (Karen) &amp; my husband Jim &amp; our daughters Keely &amp; Koreen over many years. Keely was only 3 years old when she first met Chris &amp; Koreen was also 3 when she first met him. Now they are 46 &amp; 42 years old. Chris changed my life a few years ago when he gave me lumineers for a whole better look of my teeth &amp; smile I was proud of. When Chis passed last year we were both 70 &amp; had been dentist &amp; patient for 43 years! A &nbsp;Remarkable history which I treasure! &nbsp;I miss him so much &amp; am thankful that Dr. Procopio has carried on Chris\u2019s great tradition in the footsteps of his dentistry! ~Karen N.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>You can bet he's giving a 'Fly Over' to his and all FRONT LINE workers! ~Robert M. &amp; Family</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>\"After I wrote to Dr. Wolter complementing his photo of his blue and gold macaw, he mailed me two feathers explaining that held up to the light, reveals a brilliant blue on one side and a shimmering gold on the opposite side. He included photos of him swimming with his macaw in his pool. The feathers and photos are posted on my memory bulletin board.A lovely, kind and thoughtful man.\" ~Diana G.</em>\n\n*********\n\n<em>\"Dr. Wolter had a wonderful presence and I think his joy permeated the entire office. &nbsp;I really enjoyed the 15 years we had together and will always remember his kindness.\" ~Kathy D.</em>\n\n*********\n\n<em>\"Dr. Wolter is truly missed. He was my dentist from 2002 until his death.&nbsp; Rest in heaven Dr. Wolter\" ~Janet E.</em>\n\n*********\n\n<em>\"Dr. Wolter was my dentist from 1985 until his passing.&nbsp; He was an excellent dentist and a good man.&nbsp; He is greatly missed.\" ~Margaret W.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I was a patient and friend of&nbsp; Dr. Wolter for 30+ years. He was a friendly, creative, very competent man. We would chit chat about various things and being appx. the same age, we'd cover baby boomer stuff like the 60's, the Beatles, etc. He always had&nbsp; ideas on how to work on my various dental issues and solved a lot of tough problems. I still have a plan he worked out for me posted on my refrigerator.&nbsp;</em><em>I had hoped that he would beat the cancer but alas...&nbsp;</em><em>He is missed. My condolences to all of you who worked with him and loved him.&nbsp;</em><em>Regards,&nbsp;Dennis K.</em>",

        'Due to COVID-19, only patients deemed as emergencies will be able to receive dental care during this self-isolation period (see emergency dentist blog for more information). If you do not qualify as an emergency patient but are experiencing tooth pain, there are a few steps you can take to help reduce irritation.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to help manage pain from teeth, gums, ulcers, and/or broken teeth until you visit our dental practice.\n<h3>How to manage pain from teeth while self-isolating?</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Anti Inflammatory Tablets</span></li>\n</ul>\nAnti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, and generic) and Naproxen (Aleve and generic) work particularly well against dental pain because they reduce inflammation in the traumatized areas of your mouth. Although, despite there being no definitive evidence that Ibuprofen exacerbates Coronavirus conditions, experts have recommended <a href="https://www.justonenorfolk.nhs.uk/covid-19-coronavirus-faqs/covid-19-ibuprofen-use" rel="nofollow">refraining from taking the anti-inflammatory drug</a>. So, Naproxen is probably best if you have experienced any symptoms. It is imperative that you do not exceed the recommended dosage.\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize Desensitizing toothpaste</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating desensitizing toothpaste \u200bsuch as Sensodyne repair can be a fruitful measure to combat tooth pain. Toothpaste such as Sensodyne work in two distinctive ways. Firstly, it builds a protective layer over the sensitive areas and it also assists with the removal of plaque bacteria to generate good oral health. In turn, this may help combat any irritation or pain you are experiencing whilst isolating.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Anesthetic Gel on Infected Area</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anesthetic gels are another short-term preventative step in combating tooth-pain without seeking dental care. They tend to provide fast-acting pain relief to patient discomfort. The anesthetic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gel should be applied directly to the affected area. Use the smallest amount necessary to relieve pain and use it no more than the number of times recommended daily. For an adult, product </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">labels generally recommend using only small amounts, at most 4 times daily, for a maximum of 7 days. For infants under one year of age, as little as \u00bc teaspoon of 7.5% gel (100mg).&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your head elevated to Reduce Toothache</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping at night may be extremely discomforting with a throbbing pain in your mouth. A tip would be to keep your head elevated at night when you lie down to go to sleep. Find an agreeable position in bed, which will reduce the blood pressure in your head - decreasing the overall pain in your mouth. An extra pillow can help keep your head elevated when you sleep.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>\u200b </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinse Mouth with Salt and Hot Water</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinsing your mouth with salt and hot water can help to reduce inflammation in your mouth and fight bacteria by creating an acidic environment. The mixture of salt and hot water can help to neutralize the acids in the throat that is produced by bacteria, maintaining an overall healthy pH balance. It can also help to dislodge bits of stuck food that may be causing pain, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping you to alleviate irritation and inflammation in your mouth.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a Cold Compress&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A cold compress can help reduce pain you may be experiencing in your mouth by restricting blood flow to the injured area, subsequently reducing swelling and irritation.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<em><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Never put heat externally on your face as this can draw the \u200binfection into the tissues in your face rendering swellings.</span></em>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid specific food and drinks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may already have some food aversions due to the pain you are experiencing currently. However, it is imperative that the foods and drinks you do take are neither too hot, cold, acidic, or sugary to ward off any additional pain in your mouth. It is advisable to avoid citrus fruits and juices, salty or spicy foods, and acidic foods like tomatoes. Do not drink carbonated or caffeinated drinks and refrain from consuming beer, wine, liquor, or any other type of alcohol.</span>\n<h3>How to manage pain from gums while self-isolating?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is bacteria or food debris trapped between the gum and the tooth, this can cause pain.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean the area &amp; rinse thoroughly&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, it is essential that you practice good oral hygiene, particularly if you have toothache. Make sure to brush at least twice a day with a sensitive toothpaste and ensure your mouth is thoroughly clean.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>How to manage pain from ulcers while self-isolating?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst Mouth ulcers are common and caused by a number of factors, in some cases, it can be a sign of underlying medical conditions. You are advised to seek dental care if you have an ulcer that has not healed in over two weeks.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce the discomfort, you can try:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anaesthetic gel such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orajel,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bonjela or Anbesol</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To help with the healing of ulcers, you can try:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply Gengigel - can be effective as well as in soothing the pain</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinsing the mouth with salt and hot water</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms which are causing mouth pain, please call our dental practice immediately!&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A broken or knocked-out tooth \u2013 we recommend that you rinse the mouth with warm water to keep the area clean and put a cold compress on the face to reduce swelling. Immediately contact our office.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objects caught between teeth \u2013 we recommend that you gently try and remove the object with dental floss and we strongly recommend not to try and remove the object with a sharp or pointed instrument. If you are not successful, contact our office.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toothache that forces you to take pain medication (ibuprofen or tylenol) every four hours</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost/broken a temporary or permanent crown or bridge causing irritation.</span></li>\n</ul>',

        '<h2>The Importance of Practicing Good Dental Health</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Periodontitis, also called gum disease, is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue and, without treatment, can destroy the bone that supports your teeth. Increasingly, Periodontitis has been identified as cultivating long-term health problems in a number of patients, rendering diseases such as endocarditis, chronic kidney disease, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease or in some cases, adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Periodontitis is common but largely preventable. It\'s usually the result of poor oral hygiene. Brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups can greatly improve your chances of successful treatment for periodontitis and can also reduce your chance of developing it. But that is only if you continue to practice good dental hygiene. Without these practices, you can leave yourself vulnerable to a variety of long term health implications that can seriously hinder your quality of life should you choose to neglect your teeth. To provide insight into these issues, here is a list of the long-term health problems associated with gum disease.</p>\n\n<h2>Gum Disease Linked to Endocarditis</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Endocarditis is a rare, life-threatening inflammation of the lining of the heart muscle and its valves. It is caused by a bacterial infection. In very rare cases, bacteria in the mouth may trigger endocarditis in people at higher risk.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What causes endocarditis exactly? Well, bacteria found in tooth plaque may multiply and cause gingivitis (gum disease), rendering inflamed (red or swollen) gums which will bleed during manipulation of the gums usually involved during brushing, flossing or other dental procedures. The problem with this is that when the gums bleed, bacteria can enter the bloodstream, infecting other parts of the body. Endocarditis, in particular, is known to affect the inner lining of the heart and the surfaces of its valves. Bacteria stick to these surfaces and creates growths or pockets of bacteria, negatively affecting your quality of life! Whilst Endocarditis is rare, it is a fatal disease that triggers a range of life-threatening complications, such as heart failure and strokes.</p>\n\n<h2>Gum Disease linked to Respiratory Diseases</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Gum disease can extend beyond the realm of tooth and bone decay and in fact cause serious respiratory issues, which in some cases, can result in death!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Consequently, maintaining periodontal health may contribute to a healthy respiratory system. A number of scientific studies have suggested that periodontal disease may increase the risk of respiratory infections, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. These infections, which are caused when bacteria from the upper throat are inhaled into the lower respiratory tract, can be severely debilitating and are one of the leading causes of death in the U.S.</p>\n\n<h2>Gum Disease Linked to Cardiovascular Disease</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Researchers and health experts have also examined the link between gum disease and cardiovascular health. As aforementioned, Gum disease begins when plaque builds up around teeth. Similarly, a different type of plaque made of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in the blood \u2014 can also build up inside arteries, commonly known as atherosclerosis. This plaque is the cause of coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">It is stipulated that people with gum disease have two to three times the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or other serious cardiovascular events. Whilst there is no definitive evidence to suggest that there is a direct connection between gum disease and cardiovascular problems, researchers still suggest it could be an underlying factor. This is because periodontal disease increases the body\u2019s burden of inflammation - which over a prolonged period of time, is a key contributor to many health problems such as atherosclerosis (a disease where plaque builds up in your arteries).</p>\n\n<h2>Periodontal Disease Linked to adverse Pregnancy Outcomes</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Another major problem associated with unhealthy gums is the adverse pregnancy outcomes they can cause. Several studies have investigated the occurrence of periodontal disease during pregnancy, yielding a wide variation in prevalence. Pregnant women with periodontal disease have been reported to be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight! Again, whilst the evidence is not fully conclusive, there is a compelling trend to suggest that poor dental hygiene resulting in periodontal disease can affect the quality of a newborn\'s life in one way or another.</p>\n\n<h2>How do we prevent these dangerous diseases from occurring?</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Simply, you must brush and floss your teeth regularly as well as attending routine check-ups at the dentist to safeguard yourself from dangerous diseases. Whilst forgetting to maintain good dental hygiene may not seem like a pivotal part of your everyday life short-term, the consequences, in some cases, could be deadly!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">At our family dental practice, we can provide quality dental care to your whole family.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages of our family dental care include:</h2>\n<h3>Convenience</h3>\n\u2013 We are happy to schedule appointments for multiple family members on the same day, to reduce travel and missed time from work or school.\n<h3>Vigilance</h3>\n\u2013 When we treat your entire family, we develop a deep understanding of lifestyle and hereditary conditions that may impact oral health. This helps us intercept problems early, when they are most reversible, and treatment is efficient and economical. We also keep a watchful eye on the oral development of children for possible need of orthodontic intervention.\n<h3>Safety</h3>\n\u2013 By building trusting relationships with families, we know your medical background \u2013 what health issues you may be managing and what medications you take. Should you have a dental emergency, you can count on prompt care with this higher level of assurance.\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, you can rest assured knowing your oral health is monitored to safeguard you from costly procedures in the long-run should you neglect your teeth. Call today for your routine check-ups and bring the whole family along. You will not regret it!</p>',

        '<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Are you missing a tooth? Or do you have problems with your existing dental restorations? Well the chances are you have questions. To help answer these, we have created a list of the top 5 benefits associated with Dental Implants that will provide you with insight into what they are, how they function and why they are an extremely popular service.</p>\n\n<h2>They Look Natural</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Firstly, one of the main benefits of our dental implants services is their overall naturalistic effect. Dental implants are carefully crafted and designed to look, feel and function like your natural teeth, thus alleviating the many problems associated with the likes of dental dentures, which usually render sore and swelling gums.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Besides the physical benefits analogous with naturalistic teeth, they also positively affect your mental well-being as well. Implants that rectify missing gaps in your teeth enable patients to have the confidence to smile, eat and engage in social activities without being self-conscious about how they look or if the teeth will stay properly aligned and in place. We have all heard the horror stories of dentures falling out when eating, entirely creating an awkward moment for you and other diners. Thankfully, this is not a problem associated with Implants.</p>\n\n<h2>Long-lasting And Reliable</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Following on from the previous point, with delicate maintenance and care, implants have a durable, long-lasting lifespan. Implants last as long as conventional restorations on teeth, with predictable outcomes. So for instance, biting into an apple, taco shell, or even a piece of chicken will ensure the implant stays firmly in place and will not rock back and forth like false teeth. While this may not sound like too big of a deal, the outcome is actually fairly severe for the rest of the teeth in the mouth - cultivating cracked enamel on teeth and painful lacerations on the cheeks, gums or tongue. Again, implants safeguard you from these unfortunate epilogues.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The best part? With a longer lifespan than other dental services, they can be regarded as a terrific investment in long term oral health - with mental and social benefits too!</p>\n\n<h2>High Success Rate</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">With regular maintenance and care for your implants, these dental procedures can present you with high survival rates. Since they came to fruition in 1970, and now part of day-to-day dental practice, technological developments and techniques have facilitated an increased success rate of implants, particularly in comparison to other teeth replacement options. So, keeping on top of cleaning, flossing and all things implant-maintenance means you will have the best chance for successful, well-functioning dental implants.</p>\n\n<h2>Improved Ability To Eat And Chew</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Sometimes the difficulty with losing a tooth and wearing dentures is that you have to modify what you eat. Meats or sticky foods are a no go with dentures (these include taffy, caramel, marshmallows, peanut butter and raisins). This is primarily due to their ability to affect the fundamental chewing teeth - the upper and lower molars - which consequently dislodge dentures.&nbsp; With Dental Implants there is no need to fear about changing your dietary requirements, as once these dental implants are stable, you can drink and eat as usual (even the sugary stuff in moderation).</p>\n\n<h2>Dental Implants Can Improve facial And Bone Features</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Maintaining your natural bone is one of the most important advantages of dental implants. With missing teeth, the bone begins to resorb over time. Significant bone loss can shrink the contours of the jawbone, causing wrinkled lips and a sunken mouth and chin.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How dental implants function is by preserving the natural tooth tissues by avoiding the need to cut down adjacent teeth for conventional bridgework. Consequently, by placing a dental implant in your jaw bone, this energizes new bone growth through a process called osseointegration; conserving future bone loss. By ensuring that your jawbones are firmly intact - your facial structure will be sufficiently supported!</p>\n\n<h2>Why Are Dental Implants Beneficial For Me?</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Dental implants provide a wide array of benefits for patients, which enable them to smile, eat and act normal without having to worry about the functionality of the tooth. These dental procedures can also prevent the onset of extreme side-effects associated with missing teeth such as bone loss and the deconstruction of your face!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Dental implants are a cost-effective solution to improved dental care and hygiene, particularly in comparison to other restorations that may need extensive maintenance by a dentist on a regular basis. With dental implants, once they are orally fitted and successfully placed, you are good to go. They are also easy to clean and care for, requiring just frequent brushing, dental check-ups and routine hygienist appointments as you would expect with natural teeth.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">So, to create a confident smile, call our practice today or visit our <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-implants/">dental implants section</a> online to find out all about our services and prices for your very own dental implant.</p>',

        '<h2>What is preventative dentistry?</h2>\n<p>Preventive dentistry refers to the process of maintaining good oral health via a combination of regular dental check-ups coincided with frequent brushing and flossing. These preventative steps start early in childhood and extend throughout the course of one\'s life.</p>\n<h3>What are common preventive dentistry services?</h3>\n<p><strong>Preventive dentistry services may include: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular oral exams (usually every 6 months)</li>\n<li>Teeth Cleaning</li>\n<li>Routine X-rays</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What\u2019s your role in preventive dental care?</h2>\n<p>Preventive dental care starts directly with you. Acquiring healthy habits early in life can help reduce cavities, gum disease and gingivitis. Basic procedures in order to maintain good oral health:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brush teeth regularly - at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste</li>\n<li>Floss daily to remove food particles in tight crevices in the teeth which may turn into plaque</li>\n<li>Use a mouthwash to rinse out food particles after flossing.</li>\n<li>Refrain from drinking and eating acidic solutions which can affect tooth enamel and subsequently cause decay</li>\n<li>Be cautious with hard foods which may damage or chip teeth</li>\n<li>Avoid smoking as it can produce bacterial plague, which cultivates the onset of gum disease.</li>\n<li>Mouth guards should be utilised during sporting activities and during nighttime if you are renowned for teeth grinding</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the benefits of preventive dentistry?</h2>\n<p><strong>Lowers your risk of developing tooth decay, gum disease, gingivitis and periodontitis </strong></p>\n<p>With preventive dentistry, dentists can examine your smile every six months during routine dental check ups. Once assessing your teeth, gums and jaw joints, dentists can screen your smile to check for signs of oral cancer and periodontal disease. Preventive methods can then be put in place if they identify any indicators of concern, often in the earliest stages before you experience serious discomfort.</p>\n<p>Indeed, when you avoid the onset of tooth decay and gum disease, the risk of losing those teeth decreases incrementently. Routine cleanings also facilitate the brightening of your teeth, which ultimately protects your smile from discolouration.</p>\n<p><strong>Helps promote good oral hygiene habits such as brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing</strong></p>\n<p>Participating in preventive dentistry can strengthen your smile\u2019s natural defences. When attending routine check-ups, dentists can provide fluoride treatment in addition to extensive tooth cleaning; both of which has the ability to remove all plaque and tartar from the teeth, safeguarding them from developing cavities, gingivitis and tooth-decay. The dental team will show you the most effective ways to brush, and how to clean in between your teeth utilising inter dental brushes or floss to remove the bacterial plaque - promoting good oral hygiene habits.</p>\n<p><strong>Early identification of dental problems may help minimise treatment and cost</strong></p>\n<p>If preventive programs are started early by the patient (or, preferably, by the parents of young children) long-range freedom from the plaque diseases is a possible sound cost-benefit investment. Indeed, over time the costs associated with poor oral hygiene can rapidly increase. Preventive dentistry may not completely eliminate your need for fillings, root canals or dental implants, but it can go a long way to reducing your need for these costly treatments. Thus, for the patient who thinks in terms of economic benefits and enjoyment of life, prevention pays.</p>\n<p><strong>Provides Overall Health Benefits </strong></p>\n<p>Considering that oral health is linked to overall health, preventive dentistry is important for your overall well being. Oral diseases can interfere with eating, speaking, daily activities and self-esteem. In children, severe decay can affect growth and development. Preventive dentistry can result in less extensive \u2013 and less expensive \u2013 treatment for any dental conditions that may develop, and help you keep your natural teeth for a lifetime. Moreover, the absence of teeth or presence of broken-down teeth often results in a loss of self-esteem, minimizes employment possibilities and often curtails social interaction, all of which can be combated by partaking in preventive dentistry.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To find out more about Preventive Dentistry, <a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>\u00a0your Dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

Everyone struggles with teeth staining issues at one or some point in life. Most of it usually comes with age or other factors. At the same time, nobody likes to look in the mirror with discolored teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to ADA estimations, over 37 million Americans use teeth whitening products to eliminate teeth staining. Untreated discolored teeth can give rise to various dental problems\u2014for example, dental caries, gum disease, and tooth decay. Let\'s discover habits that cause stained teeth and what to do if your teeth are already stained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Types of Teeth Stains</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are three primary teeth stains: extrinsic, intrinsic, and age-related stains. Extrinsic stains make their home on the outer part of the tooth, i.e., the enamel. And because they do not enter the inner part, these stains are easier to remove. Intrinsic stains affect the dentin layer, which lies beneath the enamel. These stains are a little harder to remove but are still removable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5734,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/7a.jpg" alt="Everyday Habits That Cause Teeth Staining" class="wp-image-5734"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The age-related stains cause tooth discoloration as age progresses. Here, the enamel gets thinner, and the dentin layer becomes darker. These stains are also difficult to remove, but professional teeth whitening procedures can significantly help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, the question arises, what causes teeth stains? There are a couple of reasons that cause stained teeth. These include medications, trauma, the aging process, amalgam restorations, oral diseases, poor dental hygiene, excess fluoride, etc. Here, we\'ll look deeply into some everyday habits that cause stained teeth so that you can play your role. Let\'s explore them one by one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Everyday Habits That Cause Stained Teeth</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Drinking Teeth-Staining Beverages</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many teeth-staining beverages cause teeth staining. These include coffee, cola, soda, tea, sports, carbonated drinks, energy drinks, citrus juice, etc. It\'s better to limit these drinks as much as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, some people can\'t live without tea or coffee.

Limit foods with intense colors, such as berries, lollipops, and beetroots. Similarly, avoid acidic and sugary foods that can wear down the enamel.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, some foods are essential and healthy, despite their color.

Having a family dentist is convenient and best for a dental emergency. It simplifies oral care, and tracking dental history becomes relatively easy. However, finding the best family dentist can be challenging. You want someone who can treat you professionally and with compassion, whereas very few excel in these two domains.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, we live in a digital age where finding the right dentist is easier than ever. You can find a lot of information about a particular dentist by reading online reviews and exploring his website. But what should you look to make a decision? The following guideline is all there to help you find the right dentist near you. So, let\'s start.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Aim for Convenience</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Convenience is an essential factor, especially when you are choosing a family dentist. The dental office should be close to your home or workplace so that you can easily visit the dentist or take your family members with ease for regular dental visits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, consider office hours apart from the location. It may be hard for you to visit the dentist when he has the same office hours as you. Choose a dentist who works late hours at least once a week so that he can accommodate your needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Look for Comprehensive Services</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting comprehensive care under one roof makes life much easier. It is especially true when trying to meet multiple family members\' dental needs. A family dentist should be able to provide a wide range of services, for instance:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5709,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/917.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5709"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Fillings, root canals, and crown placement.</li><li>Children\'s dentistry.</li><li>Dental implants.</li><li>Clear braces.</li><li>Gum disease treatment.</li><li>Dental implants.</li><li>Dentures.</li><li>TMJ Therapy, etc.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, ensure the chosen dentist offers emergency services, treats patients of all ages, and is well-equipped with modern technology.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Ask People for Recommendations</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It\'s always good to ask for recommendations from people whom you trust.

Look for dentists with at least 4+ ratings on various platforms and shortlist by reading patients\' positive reviews. The more positive reviews reflect excellent expertise in dealing with patients.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Online reviews can say a lot about a particular dentist.

  //     '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The procedure for a root canal is where a dental professional removes bacteria or dead tissue from the tooth, relieving pain caused by an infected or abscessed tooth. The dentist drains out the inflamed pulp during the root canal procedure and cleans the inner surfaces of the tooth to disinfect it, followed by the placement of a filling to seal the space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Toothache is the first sign that you might need a root canal. The pain can range from mild to extremely bad, and your gums may also hurt and swell up where the problem is. You should visit your dentist if the toothache is persistent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Steps Involved in Root Canal Procedure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, a root canal may sound frightening, but the truth is that a root canal may be made painless because of developments in dentistry. Root canal procedure\u202ftypically involves two or three clinic visits and includes the following methods:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#1 \u2013 Dental Examination</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5702,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/822.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5702"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dentist will first examine your teeth. You may have to get one or two X-rays to know the intensity of inflammation and tooth decay. Once your tooth is diagnosed with the infection, the dentist uses a Local anesthesia injection, numbing the tooth for treatment and surrounding tissues. It may take some time to numb a tooth with acutely irritated pulp, but your dentist will wait to begin treatment until you are comfortable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#2 \u2013 Dental Dam Placement</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dentist will then place a dental dam - a thin sheet of rubber or vinyl on the affected tooth to expose it while the natural teeth are covered. It helps to perform\u202fthe root canal procedure in a sterile condition, free from contamination by microorganisms present in saliva or the rest of the mouth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#3 \u2013 Creation of Access Point</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, the dentist will make a tiny hole in the tooth\'s biting point, or top, to access the pulp chamber and root canal. This opening provides access for treatment to the pulp chamber and root canals. Although it might appear scary,\u202fthis part won\'t hurt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5703,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/821.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5703"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#4 \u2013 Cleaning Process</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dentist will then use a set of surgical tools to clean out root canals of the tooth- the pulp chamber and possibly apply antiseptic/antibiotics to ensure no infection is left to cause pain. This procedure is not painful; the area is numb, and the removed tissue is either dead or dying.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#5 \u2013 Sterilization</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After removing the infected tissues, the dentist will add a small cotton ball soaked in the antiseptic liquid to sterilize the channels to eliminate any remaining bacteria. The tooth will have a temporary filling, and you will be sent home with the given medications. Your dentist will schedule you for a next appointment at this stage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#6 \u2013 Removal of Temporary Fillings</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dentist removes the temporary filling at your second appointment. To properly seal the channels, your dentist will add adhesive fillers. Later the dentist might use small files to shape the inner chamber to fill the canals with the gutta-percha substance (rubber-like material): To make it fit against the walls, the dentist compresses it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Step#7 \u2013 Tooth Impression</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that your tooth is ready for the permanent crown to cover, the dentist will take an impression of your tooth with a silicone-based material, and your tooth impression will then be sent to the lab to get your crown. The clinic will then call you once your crown is ready.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Final Step \u2013 Crown Placement</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dental professional completes the procedure by placing a permanent crown on the tooth. To make the crown placement or restoration stable, the dentist might need to insert a small post for additional support inside the root chamber, depending on the state of your original tooth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After completing root canal therapy, you must take proper care of your teeth and gums. Keep up effective oral hygiene practices at home by brushing twice daily, flossing once daily, and scheduling regular dental cleanings and exams. After a root canal procedure, the tooth stays healthy for the rest of your life with the proper care and attention.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS, at\u00a0Procopio Towle Dental Office to learn more about the root canal procedure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/how-is-a-root-canal-procedure-done/">How Is A Root Canal Procedure Done?</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

A dental crown saves and protects a compromised tooth and keeps it away from further decay and damage. Besides giving better aesthetics, the dental crown help relieves discomfort. Thanks to modern dentistry, you can enjoy the benefits of same-day crowns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental crowns are available in two types, i.e., traditional and same-day dental crowns. Both are effective and provide restorative treatment to save a tooth prone to excessive usage, broken, chipped, or damaged. However, the latter saves your time and an extra trip to the dentist. Moreover, there is no need for temporary crown placement as with the traditional crown. Many people are still unaware of the fact that same-day crowns exist. However, this article aims to enlighten you so you can make an informed decision. So, let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What Is a Same-Day Crown?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5687,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/746.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5687"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the same suggests, the same-day crown is a single-visit crown created right in your dentist\u2019s office. Same-day crowns are as efficient as traditional crowns and last for about 10-15 years on average. However, with excellent care, they can even last for a decade or even throughout your lifetime.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The lab-created crowns usually require at least two dental appointments for the entire procedure. Moreover, the permanent crown takes around 2-3 weeks to prepare before it can place in the patient\u2019s mouth. Busy people mostly want treatment in just one sitting and can avail of same-day crown placement.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Same-day crowns use CEREC technology and are highly convenient. They provide significant restoration to the affected tooth and do not require any temporary crown placement. Learn more benefits about same-day crowns from the information given below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>5 Benefits of Same-Day Crowns</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Same-day crowns offer a cost-effective way to restore a tooth. Traditional crowns are also cost-effective compared to dental implants. However, same-day crowns are more cost-effective because they do not require a second dental visit. Moreover, there is no need to pay an extra fee for placing a temporary crown as traditional crown placement does.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>More Comfortable</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fixing and placing a temporary crown might not be comfortable for many people. Same-day crowns eliminate your need for temporary crowns as you can get them immediately. They might also bring added tooth sensitivity to the tooth under treatment. So, same-day crowns are more comfortable and allow a snugger fit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Provide Greater Protection</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Same-day crowns provide excellent and instant protection to the damaged tooth due to their efficient single-sitting placement. The purpose of conventional crowns is also to protect the affected tooth. However, the same-day crown method provides added protection because the temporary crown isn\u2019t required. A temporary crown does not cover the tooth or protect it from decay. Moreover, a temporary crown does not always fit well in the patient\u2019s mouth and can come loose.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>No Worries About Impression Putty</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many patients cannot tolerate impression putty as it induces a natural gag reflex. Instead, the dentist takes digital impressions of the affected tooth and does not require invasive measures. If they opt for same-day crowns, they can eliminate this dental anxiety.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Designed With More Precision</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dentist works on the same day crown until it\u2019s perfect in all dimensions. Same-day crowns use CEREC technology that gives them more precision than traditional crowns. They look better, are perfectly natural, aid in chewing food, and are highly durable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why not avail yourself of a same-day crown to restore your tooth and beautify your smile? Same-day crowns immediately restore the tooth\u2019s integrity and imperfection. Creating these crowns using biocompatible material gives added protection that saves a tooth from further decay. Instead of waiting for weeks, you can get same-day crowns within the same day. They have a quicker turnaround and are highly budget-friendly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="tel:925-933-5677">Contact</a>\u00a0your Walnut Creek Dentist, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>,\u00a0to know more about the benefits of Same-Day Crowns</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="http://CEREC Same Day Crowns">CEREC Same Day Crowns</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

If your teeth are crooked or uneven, your dentist may recommend braces before placing the veneers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this step, your dentist will probably take X-rays to examine your dental health.

In case you face any of these problems, veneers may not be a solution for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the next visit, your dentist will take off around half a millimeter of your teeth (using a cutting instrument to take the surface) before taking a mold (imprint) of your tooth.

According to the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, more than half a million people opt for dental implants yearly. This figure is in addition to millions of people who have already had implant surgery in the past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, dental implants do not suit everyone. It illustrates that we must look at characteristics determining the ideal patient for implant surgery. So, let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Good health</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyone in good overall health is an ideal candidate for dental implants. The implant surgery requires the patient to not suffer from illnesses like diabetes, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. These things prevent the implant from fusing with the patient\u2019s jawbone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly, if the patient is on any prior medication, it can interfere with calcium processing, for instance. It might damage the jawbone\u2019s ability to heal around the implant screw. Patients on chemotherapy aren\u2019t the best candidates for implants as this therapy weakens the bone structure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Adequate Bone Density</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants also require sufficient bone density for their protection and support. The patient must have a strong jaw to anchor implants. People who have inadequate bone density can still get the implants. However, they\u2019ll require a procedure before placing the implants, i.e., bone grafting. It helps rebuild the patient\u2019s bone to make it easier for implant placement.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Healthy Gums</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Healthy gums are a prerequisite for implant surgery. Ideally, patients should not suffer from gum diseases like periodontitis or gingivitis. They must cure them if they have such conditions before opting for the implant\u2019s procedure. The implants cannot heal correctly if the gums are weak. Therefore, the patient\u2019s gums must be healthy to support and bond with the implants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5547,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/416.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5547"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Great Oral Health Hygiene</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An ideal candidate should also have great oral health hygiene. It is crucial because such patients can care for their implants better. Dental implants, once placed, require adequate caring so that they can last for long. Patients who are already fond of maintaining their oral health hygiene would be willing to care for them appropriately.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Minimal Bruxism</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Patients who struggle with teeth clenching or grinding risk failing to achieve the optimum benefits of dental implants. Dental implants require patience from the patient\u2019s side so that he doesn\u2019t exert pressure on teeth when faced with anxiety. If a patient cannot control clenching his teeth as a way of his habit, he is not a well-suited candidate for implants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants might be the best option if your oral health isn\u2019t in good shape and you want a durable treatment. However, you need to fulfill the essential criteria to avail of the treatment. If you aren\u2019t a tobacco user and have a generally good state of health, you might be an ideal candidate.

It might be because they feel frustrated with waiting for their turn or cannot travel. However, they need treatment on an immediate basis but cannot go out to see a dentist. A mobile dental unit can provide significant help in this regard. It keeps patients in their comfort zone, getting appropriate consultation and quality treatment for their problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5543,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/351.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5543"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Offers Easy Access to Everyone</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry offers easy access to oral health care to all societal groups. Be it the elderly population, disadvantaged groups, marginalized communities, or otherwise, a mobile dental unit is easily accessible. It doesn\u2019t discriminate against people based on gender, age, status, religion, race, color, caste, creed, or otherwise. Rather, it treats everyone with dignity and respect and helps to resolve patients\u2019 issues quickly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Blessing To the Elderly</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry is a promising way to reach out to the elderly population. Studies reveal that many of the elderly population who lives in nursing homes need adequate oral health care. They feel deprived of one of their few remaining pleasures of life if not treated well on time. Oral conditions adversely impact seniors\u2019 quality of life, jeopardizing their nutritional status. Mobile dentistry uses technologically advanced equipment and provides restorative and preventive oral health services.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Provides Immediate Help</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes patients need immediate help and cannot visit the dental clinic. For instance, children cannot go out without parents who they might stick in their busy work schedules. Similarly, at times, there is a dental emergency, and the patient is alone at home and can\u2019t leave to avail of the treatment. In such a case, mobile dentistry is of valuable help. It provides immediate dental care at the doorstep, where patients feel receive quality treatment within the comfort of the mobile unit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Expands The Patient Base Exponentially</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry helps to boost dental practice. It expands the patient base exponentially and has low startup costs than a traditional clinic. A dentist can increase his efficiency with the help of modern dental care and advanced materials. Moreover, he can work on new cases to boost his dental experience while working within the community.\u202f\u202f</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mobile dentistry focuses on the disadvantaged groups of society. It helps alleviate their problems instantly. Patients receive an efficient, accurate, and friendly quality of treatment from certified and trained medical staff. This way, they do not need to go out and wait for long hours to fix their dental problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead, they receive immediate help and feel relaxed after getting the treatment. If you are looking for a mobile dental clinic in your area, search on Google and get your work done in the best possible manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>\u00a0your Dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>\u00a0to know more about the benefits of mobile dentistry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/benefits-of-a-family-dentistry/">Benefits of A Family Dentistry</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>\u202f</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

The design\'s approach helps make people look younger. They mimic the natural tooth and aid in getting a perfect smile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Types of Dentures</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Complete/Full Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Complete/full dentures replace all of the patient\'s missing teeth and take up the whole upper and lower jaw. They are made of acrylic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Partial Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Partial dentures are mostly made of the metal framework and prevent teeth from shifting. They help to replace one or more missing teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5525,"width":263,"height":175,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/314.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5525" width="263" height="175"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Implant-Supported Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These dentures combine two modern prosthetics, i.e., dentures and implants. Dental implants support this denture for enhanced productivity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Custom Made Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These dentures are more costly than traditional dentures and give a natural look. These dentures are custom-fitted into the patient\'s mouth and are visually appealing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Immediate Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immediate dentures are well-suited for people with sufficient time for dental appointments. However, the patient has to be a good candidate for these dentures. They are ready the same day the patient undergoes tooth extraction or removal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Snap-in Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These dentures are highly stable and add convenience to the patient\'s life. They are removable, just like partial dentures, and the locator attachments come within the tissue side of these dentures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Overdentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overdentures are removable, so you can place them in the maxillary (upper) or mandible (lower) jaw as per the requirement.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5524,"width":245,"height":174,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/315.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5524" width="245" height="174"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Upper Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Upper dentures are specifically for the upper teeth. These are a good option for patients who have lost their upper teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Economy Dentures</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Economy dentures are optimized to provide a cost-effective solution for denture needs. These dentures are generic and therefore need denture adhesive for securing them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Fixed Bridge</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fixed bridges replace missing teeth by surgically cementing a crown at each side of the remaining teeth. They use modern technology and are hence more costly than removable dentures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Cantilever Bridge</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is for patients whose molar is missing, and there aren\'t any teeth on its side to support the bridge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost all dentures are made-to-measure; therefore, they provide a perfect fit. It is imperative to care for the dentures to avoid plaque buildup, gum problems, and bad breath. Dentures provide a cost-effective way to restore your teeth and help elevate your smile.

If you experience any of these, be ready to visit your dentist before it gets too late. If you experience any of these symptoms, there are high chances that you need root canal therapy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5234,"width":279,"height":230,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/151.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5234" width="279" height="230"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Tooth Discoloration</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the pulp becomes infected, the tooth\'s appearance changes to grayish-black. When this happens, the person needs root canal therapy to treat the underlying infection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Constant Toothache</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People who need root canal therapy have constant irritation or pain in the tooth. This discomfort is not stimulated or initiated by any mouth activity. Instead, it happens because the pulp or soft tissue inside the root canal system becomes infected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Lingering Sensitivity</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another symptom to look for is tooth sensitivity. When a person\'s tooth becomes extremely sensitive to hot or cold foods, it might indicate a need for root canal therapy. This symptom is significant to consider when people experience tooth sensitivity for prolonged periods after food consumption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Swollen Gums or Jaw</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Swollen or sore gums indicate an infection in the pulp. So, if you experience swelling on the gums, visit your dentist right away to check whether you need root canal therapy. Some people develop a boil or pimple on their gums. It causes an unpleasant taste or smell when the pus from the infected tooth drains from the boil or pimple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, the jaw becomes visibly swollen, and the pus doesn\'t strain from the side.

Bacteria in a chipped or cracked tooth can easily reach the tooth pulp and cause infection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An infected tooth can also feel looser, or you continuously experience pain while chewing food.

All dental diseases arrive from poor oral health other than broken teeth due to trauma or facial injuries. Brushing twice a day is not the only care you have to follow as a preventive measure for better oral health. Flossing at least thrice a week helps get rid of the trapped germs and food particles. Using the right type and amount of toothpaste also helps improve oral health. Moreover, fluoride-containing toothpaste helps whiten teeth and provides necessary minerals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Regular visits to the clinic:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can get the right treatment only when you diagnose the problem at the right time. We often delay our visits to the clinic, taking small infections lightly. These are the germs that later spread to the other teeth and cause serious tooth decay, leading to losing natural teeth. If you treat the problem at the right time, you can save your teeth. Besides this, there must be awareness regarding regular dental checkups whether you have a dental problem. Sometimes brushing and flossing do not help clean the mouth thoroughly, so we need regular cleaning from professionals to remove the micro germs and retain the natural shine of our teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Mouthguards:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5206,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/108.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5206"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bruxism or teeth grinding is a sleeping habit that can cause crooked teeth. This can damage the teeth and affect the jawbone and physical appearance of your mouth. If you have teeth-grinding, mouthguards or nightguards are the best preventive tools to keep your teeth safe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Fluoride treatments:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our teeth need minerals for their better health and strength. These minerals come from our diet and toothpaste, but sometimes lack of certain types of diet due to any reason can lead to demineralization of the teeth. Fluoride treatment is for the remineralization of the teeth to make them work properly and gives them a bleaching effect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Practicing preventive care makes you less likely to face any dental issue in the future and reduces the risk of teeth loss at an older age. Getting regular checkups and following good oral hygiene should be taken seriously for every age group to avoid any complications in the future. If you are lacking any preventive care, start following it now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To find out more about preventive dentistry,\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>\u00a0your Dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://pwdds.com/the-benefits-of-preventive-dentistry/">The Benefits of Preventive Dentistry</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

First, the cosmetic dentist connects a screw to the jaw to maintain it. Next, the implant is attached to the missing tooth\'s bone socket.

There are many options available in the market for treating bad breath. Still, those are temporary solutions, like mouthwashes or mouth fresheners. However, if the underlying cause remains untreated, it is impossible to permanently get rid of the bad breath. So knowing the cause of halitosis is the first step toward its treatment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Causes:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Poor oral hygiene:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you eat something, the first place where food enters and gets crushed is your mouth. Food particles get stuck between the teeth and in the pointed ends of our molars and premolars. When the germs contact these food particles, they start deteriorating, and the teeth get contaminated. These residing food particles cause bad breath by releasing harmful products. These germs then cause cavities and plaque, which gets piled up on the teeth, thus causing permanent bad breath if it remains uncleaned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Dry mouth:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some medical conditions like xerostomia cause chronic dry mouth, which also causes bad breath. The saliva produced in our mouth helps detoxify and cleanse gums. It neutralizes the acidic pH of the mouth and reduces the chances of bacterial growth. The morning breath is also caused due to a dry mouth because saliva is not frequently produced while sleeping, and it gets worse if the mouth remains open.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5142,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vigo-17.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5142"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Drugs:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some drugs are broken down into smaller compounds and release chemicals that cause bad breath, e.g., some tranquilizers and nitrates. Some medications like antibiotics cause dry mouth by decreasing the amount of released saliva and contributing to mouth odor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other conditions like tobacco smoking and some medical conditions like mouth and throat illness are also the reasons for chronic bad breath.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Treatment:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first-line treatment is cleaning the teeth properly and thoroughly. If the odor is due to plaque, cavities, or poor oral hygiene, getting the teeth cleaned once by the dentist can help you get rid of the odor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Brushing the teeth twice and flossing them twice a week is the best step toward treating bad breath permanently.</li><li>Anything that goes into your mouth, like dentures, should be cleaned daily.</li><li>Suppose the bad breath is due to underlying medical conditions. In that case, treating the diseases first is the only way to solve the bad breath problems.</li><li>Avoid dry mouth and clean your tongue to remove the residue of the food.</li><li>Avoid tobacco and foods that release chemicals causing odor like onions and garlic. Using a mouthwash after eating anything which causes a bad smell is recommended.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking care of your oral hygiene is as important as cleaning your teeth.

But now it\'s 2022, and sedation dentistry has all the solutions to your distress. You don\'t need to wait until the last moment to visit the dentist for a detailed checkup or avoid dental visits for fear of pain during the surgery. With sedation dentistry, even tooth extraction doesn\'t feel painful, so dental treatments are much more convenient for people, and they are encouraged to go to a clinic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Methods of Sedation:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Oral Sedation:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5044,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vig-39.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5044"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The oral sedation pills produce unconsciousness in patients. They make the patient drowsy and sleepy during dental treatments. Oral sedation, as compared to other types of sedation, produce more after-effects. The patient will not be able to drive him home safely, so he needs someone to monitor because the consciousness comes after some time when the effect of the pills goes down. If a kid is getting oral sedation, parents must supervise their children until he is fully awake and conscious. It can take a few hours to one day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Laughing gas:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Laughing gas works wonders when it comes to moderate sedation. It takes just a few moments to start the sedation and is easy to wear off. Your dentist will give you a mask to place on your nose and will ask you to take deep breaths so that the gas can travel through your nostrils. Once it starts going inside, the process of sedation begins within seconds. The patient cannot feel pain and discomfort during the process but is fully awake. The after-effects are very few, so it is safe to drive yourself home after getting the treatment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>IV Sedation:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5045,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vig-38.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5045"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>IV sedation uses the intravenous method to insert the anesthesia. It can be local and general anesthesia. The local anesthesia only produces sedation in a specific part, like the gums only for teeth extraction. The patient remains awake but can feel no pain or discomfort. General anesthesia is not particular to a special region. Rather, it produces unconsciousness and causes the whole body to rest. The IV insertion mostly uses the arm veins for injection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Types of sedative drugs:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For laughing gas sedation, nitrous oxide is used widely to produce unconsciousness. Sedative pills like diazepam, zaleplon, triazolam, and midazolam are prescribed for oral sedation. Most dentists use liquid sedative drugs and IV methods for insertion because of their safety and no side effects. All the benzodiazepines like valium, versed, and Ativan are preferred for IV sedation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sedation dentistry is used to induce unconsciousness during the treatment process. However, a little pain that comes after the effect of sedative drugs wears down is normal. You can avoid the pain with mild painkillers and do not try to put pressure on the treated tooth right after the treatment.

Thanks to extensive research and development in dental health technology, restorative dentistry is the best solution to restore your dental health.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our overall well-being depends upon oral hygiene and dental health because how and what we eat goes through the mouth first.

People need fillings when only a small portion of the tooth is damaged. The decays and cavities, when they occur, have a very slow prognosis, so if you get a proper checkup at the right time, you can restore your natural tooth with dental fillings.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Root Canal:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When dental decay cannot be treated with fillings only. And if you face severe toothache, a root canal treatment can relieve the pain. In this way, the teeth get disconnected from the blood supply and nerves, so there is no future pain or decay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Dental Crowns:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":4989,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vig-15.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4989"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When only the upper chewing surface of the tooth is not working properly and need a little treatment, then crowns are the best choice for you. The exterior faces damage due to the wear and tear process and maybe aggressively eating solid foods. Dental crowns are the caps of your teeth size which cover the surface and provide a healthy surface area for chewing. They are attached with the teeth glue or cement, so there is no chance of them falling off the surface.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Dental Implants:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are the perfect and permanent fit for your missing teeth. Unlike other artificial teeth, the implants last longer due to their ability to stick within the jawbone. Your dentist will drill the screw into your jawbone, attach the abutment, and then the dental crown.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Dentures:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most beneficial treatment for old age is for people who face teeth loss due to weak gum strength or resolving bone issues. They also work if you lose your teeth due to severe facial traumas. Dentures are synthetic teeth along with gums and upper palates as well. You just need to get proper cleaning from your Dentist, who will remove all the residing particles in your teeth and get you the new ones. They can be complete (for all teeth) and partial (for only missing teeth) as well, and you can put them in or remove them whenever you want.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":4988,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vig-14.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4988"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other restorative dentistry procedures like tooth extraction, composite binding, space binders, veneers, etc., are also in practice for different purposes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Restorative dentistry has solutions for all of your dental problems.

In this article, we will discuss the principles and how do fixed bridges work and throw light on what to expect from this treatment. So, let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Working Principles of Fixed Bridges:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Fixed bridge is tooth-colored and works just like natural teeth. It is super easy to maintain and does not fall out of place compared to partial dentures. It is fixed in the mouth to ease up the patient\u2019s tasks, and he can sleep and eat with it comfortably.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fixed bridges work in a way that they fill the gap created by the missing teeth. It does this by securing a false tooth to the surrounding teeth, which acts as a bridge between their healthy teeth. The surrounding teeth help protect and hold the bridge to the maximum extent. The patient can easily chew and smile with confidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bridge placement is not a surgical procedure, and the patient stays awake during the treatment. However, the dentist might use mild sedation to relax the patient, especially if he becomes anxious. The dentist will use local anesthesia to numb the area of the mouth, and the medication will be injected directly into the gums.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, the supporting teeth will be prepared to make room for the crown placement. Afterward, the dentist will take an impression of the teeth. It is sent to the laboratory to create a custom bridge. The dentist will then make a temporary bridge to protect the patient\u2019s mouth. The temporary bridge is then replaced by the permanent bridge on the next dental visit. It is carefully cemented to ensure the best results.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":4673,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/vig-19.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4673"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What to Expect from This Treatment?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the dental bridge procedure is done, the patient might feel numb for a few hours. The numbness is felt in the tongue, gums, and mouth because of the local anesthesia. Patients might also feel some tenderness, and there is a minor sensitivity to hot and cold items for a few days. A modest amount of discomfort can be there, and you can approach your dentist if they reach a concerning level. However, you can gargle by mixing four ounces of warm water and one tablespoon of salt to ease up any discomfort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maintaining dental hygiene is a crucial factor in ensuring the bridge\u2019s success.

Porcelain veneers aren\'t the only way to change a person\'s smile, but they\'re a popular choice for patients who want a lot of control over their appearance (change color, size, shape, etc.). Veneers are a quick way to improve the appearance of your teeth and are ideal for people who have stained, chipped, or gapped teeth. On the other hand, Veneers are a long-term solution, and having them placed is a significant investment. Before you and your dentist decide whether veneers are right for you, you should educate yourself on everything you can about them, including how much they cost and how to care for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":4651,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/vig-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4651"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A veneer is a tooth-colored, wafer-thin shell that covers the front surface of teeth to improve appearance while providing strength and resilience like natural tooth enamel. During in-office procedures, they are customized to the shape of your teeth and bonded to the tooth\'s original enamel. Porcelain or resin composite materials are used to create dental veneers. We\'ll go over the distinctions between the two in more detail below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Why Do Dentists Recommend Dental Veneers?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Veneers are a more discrete option than crowns or braces.

Porcelain veneers are the best option for correcting shape and color issues, and they have a lifespan of 10 to 20 years. Porcelain veneers are typically half the price of composite veneers. In most cases, composites can be created while you wait, allowing for same-day treatment. Instead of being shaped and sculpted in a separate lab, they are shaped and carved on your teeth. Another benefit of composite veneers is their reversibility. Porcelain veneers require the reshaping of your natural teeth to accommodate the veneer. Composites require only minor prep work on your natural teeth, which means they are not permanently altered to the point where the composite material cannot be removed and replaced as needed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>Porcelain vs. Resin Veneers: What\'s the Difference?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As previously stated, porcelain veneers have several advantages, but you may also be familiar with resin composite veneers.

Whether you need filling in your front or back teeth, the composite fillings are perfect to choose, especially if you are looking for aesthetically pleasing filling material. Composite fillings easily bond with the tooth and give it great strength. It also helps to prevent any further damage making it one of the best benefits of composite fillings. These dental fillings have no mercury content, so they do not cause any long-term health effects as they are toxic-free.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Traditionally, amalgam or special-alloys fillings were used to fill tooth cavities. However, with the advancement in modern dental medicine, composite fillings are mostly recommended by dentists to fill the holes that are caused by tooth decay and cavities. There are numerous reasons for it. Here, we would like to educate you about the five notable benefits of composite fillings. So, let\u2019s this article serve you as an enlightening personal filling fact sheet so that you can consider it for treating your cavities in the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 1: Requires Less Drilling</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Compared to other filling types, the composite fillings require less drilling, and much less tooth must be removed. The amalgam fillings, for instance, require heavy drilling where a significant portion of the natural tooth must be removed, which causes a weak tooth structure. On the other hand, the composite fillings result in an overall stronger tooth without causing any harm to the tooth structure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 2: Bonds Extremely Well.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another benefit of composite fillings is that they bond exceptionally well with the original tooth and are custom crafted in the lab. They are aesthetically pleasing to patients. When bonded with the tooth enamel, they provide an added strength to the tooth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 3: Fewer Instances of Tooth Sensitivity.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Composite fillings have fewer instances of tooth sensitivity because the resin insulates the tooth against cold and hot temperatures. However, after the treatment, there are some chances of mild tooth sensitivity, which eventually goes away after some time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 4: Easily Repaired.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the composite fillings get damaged for some reason, they can be repaired. Be it hard chewing; teeth grinding, or otherwise; the composite fillings might degrade; the dentist will clean the area first and then fill it again. Moreover, the old amalgam fillings can also be replaced by composite fillings, especially if you are worried about your health due to mercury content.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Benefit # 5: Fix Cracks and Chips.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The natural-colored appearance, quick bonding, and durability of composite fillings make them ideal for repairing or fixing chips and cracks in visible teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Conclusion:</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the benefits of composite fillings are generally more durable and do not expand or contract like amalgam fillings. They look like natural teeth and bond extraordinarily well with the tooth enamel. It can be quickly placed within just a single sitting and fosters a healthy tooth structure.

It includes a comprehensive oral exam and X-rays to identify your teeth. Any misaligned teeth or jawbone resorption are treated accordingly. Assume you have periodontitis or oral cavity illness. In that situation, the disease must be treated first to avoid therapy problems. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. Thoroughly Cleaning The Pulp:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The root canal is cleaned properly before getting into the next step. Many people claim that RCT is painful, and it\'s better to pull out a tooth than get RCT. Let us dispel the myth that the process doesn\'t cause pain like all other dental procedures. It\'s always preferred to save your natural teeth instead of getting artificial ones. The patient is given local anesthesia, which produces numbness in that specific area of your oral cavity or teeth line. In this way, the candidate does not feel any pain at all. A whole is made to clean out the dead pulp and other excessive reading inside your teeth. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.

After shaping the canals, they are cleaned again to receive the material. The material which is preferably used to fill up your canals is "gutta-percha" having rubber-like consistency. After adding it into canals, it is heated to fit and attaches firmly to the walls. The canals are then sealed to ensure that the entrance of any germs is blocked.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4. Covering Up With The Crowns</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes if the teeth are damaged to a greater extent, the patient needs a crown to protect the filled pulp. The teeth become more fragile and sensitive if the height does not preserve the pulp, so adding the crown is the most crucial step that should not be missed to save the root canal and your teeth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Final Thoughts</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The whole process is carried out in only two visits.

Several reasons cause this discoloration. Many drinks such as coffee and hot drink cause these stains. Similarly, tobacco also leaves yellow marks on the teeth. Experiencing an oral injury can cause stains on the teeth. Other than that, certain antibiotics also play a role in teeth yellowing. The outer layer of the teeth, called the enamel, also becomes weak with time and eventually wears off, and the inner layer is exposed, which is yellow. So, teeth Whitening can restore the original color of your teeth, and you can smile with confidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="1-people-suitable-for-teeth-whitening">1.

Periodontal disease is considered the "silent killer" by dentists because you are unaware of what is happening to your teeth on the surface. While everything may appear fine and dandy on the surface, you may have numerous underlying concerns. Your teeth could be extracted, and there will be the need for support to other teeth, which can be provided only by dentures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="when-you-have-missing-teeth">When You Have Missing Teeth</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have already lost a tooth, you must take care of the remaining teeth to prevent further harm.

Additionally, it targets the nerve in the center of the tooth. When you start visiting your dentist early on, the cavity may be filled without causing further damage. This step is far easier than waiting until it becomes significantly severe, and it is also cost-effective. When a severely decayed tooth is diagnosed, it should be removed and replaced with partial dentures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="when-you-have-swollen-inflamed-sensitive-or-bleeding-gums">When You Have Swollen, Inflamed, Sensitive, Or Bleeding Gums</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your inflamed gums are an indication of developing periodontal conditions. The leading cause of tooth loss is gum disease. Gums start receding when you have a periodontal infection. Severity can lead to the teeth falling off from the gums. Gum diseases damage both gums and teeth, but dentures are the cure to both. Whether you are getting complete dentures or half, you will get the gums attached to the artificial teeth covering infectious gums and preventing further infection spread.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dentures are the best and most cost-effective alternative if you have a decaying, crooked, or missing tooth.

  //     "If you have a toothache, it is important to figure out what is at the root of your discomfort. From there, you can determine how to best relieve any pain, swelling, or other symptoms. If your symptoms persist for more than a day or two, see one of our dentists. We can provide guidance on how to relieve your symptoms and prevent future pain. We strongly recommend that you talk to one of our dentists before using any of the following remedies if you\u2019re pregnant, breastfeeding, or have any medical condition that may be impacted by herbal ingredients.\n<h3><em>Recommendations:</em></h3>\nFor many people, a <em><strong>saltwater rinse</strong></em> is an effective first-line treatment. Salt water is a natural disinfectant, and it can help loosen food particles and debris that may be stuck in between your teeth. Treating a toothache with salt water can also help\u00a0reduce inflammation and heal any oral wounds. A regular saltwater rinse and cold compress application can typically remedy minor irritation, but more serious toothaches may require one of our dentist\u2019s interventions. <em>Mix\u00a01/2 teaspoon (tsp) of salt into a glass of warm water and use it as a mouthwash.</em>\n\nA\u00a0<strong><em>hydrogen peroxide rinse</em></strong> may also help to relieve pain and inflammation.\u00a0Make sure you properly dilute the hydrogen peroxide. <em>To do this, mix 3 percent hydrogen peroxide with equal parts water and use it as a mouthwash. Don\u2019t swallow it.</em>\n\n<em><strong>Peppermint tea bags</strong></em> can be used to numb pain and sooth sensitive gums. <em>To do this, allow a used tea bag to cool down before applying it to the affected area.</em> It should still be slightly warm.\n\nFor thousands of years,\u00a0<em><strong>garlic</strong></em> has been recognized and used for its medicinal properties. Not only can it\u00a0kill harmful bacteria that cause dental plaque, but it can also act as a pain reliever. <em>To use this, crush a garlic clove to create a paste and apply it to the affected area. You may wish to add a tiny bit of salt. Alternatively, you can slowly chew a clove of fresh garlic.</em> Clove has been used to treat toothaches throughout history, because the oil can effectively numb pain and reduce\u00a0Inflammation. It contains eugenol, which is a natural antiseptic.\n\nIf your toothache is severe or is the result of a more serious medical condition, you need to see one of our dentists so you can treat it properly. Many toothaches will require medical attention. An over-the-counter pain reliever such as Advil or ibuprofen\u00a0could help until you see one of our dentists.\n\nYou should also see your dentist if you experience any of the following symptoms:\n<ul>\n \t<li><em>fever</em></li>\n \t<li><em>trouble breathing or swallowing</em></li>\n \t<li><em>general pain that lasts more than one or two days</em></li>\n \t<li><em>swelling</em></li>\n \t<li><em>pain when you bite</em></li>\n \t<li><em>abnormally red gums</em></li>\n \t<li><em>foul-tasting discharge, or pus</em></li>\n</ul>",

  //     "<h4><em><strong>Do you have anxiety attacks right before going to the dentist?</strong></em></h4>\nHaving an open dialogue with one of our dentists can help you. Our professional team members at Procopio Towle Dental Office understand that people are nervous or have phobias about being at the dental office because we have helped other people like you. Bring your music and headphones for your appointment. Music is especially useful if one of your specific anxiety triggers is the sound of the dental office. You may need to listen for directions from one of our team members, so keep the volume at a reasonable level. There are also some great meditation apps where you can learn how to put yourself into a more relaxed state. The great thing about this is that it can help you with more than just your dental anxiety. This visualization technique can seem overly simple, but sometimes simplicity is just what you need. Just close your eyes and imagine the one place in the world that makes you feel the most at ease. Imagine the park, the beach at sunset, or another scene in your mind and pretend you are there.\n<h4><strong>Alternative Options - Nitrous Oxide \u201cLaughing gas\u201d or Diazepam (Valium)</strong></h4>\nWhen being open with one of our dentists, listening to music, visualization, or mediation does not help your dental anxiety; it\u2019s time to consider nitrous oxide, \u201claughing gas\u201d, or ask for a prescription of Valium. Often, you will be relaxed enough that we can provide you with the necessary treatments, and we can accomplish more in one appointment to prevent having to prolong how long the full treatment plan will take. It can be easier to know that you will have a comfortable and one significant appointment rather than several smaller appointments.",

  //     'CEREC crowns are a new and innovative type of dentistry that has taken the industry by storm over the past decade. We strive for the most conservative, accurate and biocompatible dentistry possible - oh and did we mention that they can be created in a single appointment.\n\nWant to know more about these innovative dental procedures, here is our ultimate frequently asked questions for CEREC crowns...\n<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What are CEREC Crowns?\u00a0</strong></span></h2>\n<strong><u>C</u></strong>hairside <strong><u>E</u></strong>conomical <strong><u>R</u></strong>estoration of <strong><u>E</u></strong>sthetic <strong><u>C</u></strong>eramic Crowns - also known as <strong>CEREC</strong> crowns - are an innovative dental procedure that combines technology and skill to create a crown in a matter of one appointment. Utilizing <strong><u>C</u></strong>omputer <strong><u>A</u></strong>ided <strong><u>D</u></strong>esign/<strong><u>C</u></strong>omputer <strong><u>A</u></strong>ided <strong><u>M</u></strong>anufacturing technology, also known as <strong>CAD/CAM</strong> dentistry, this new field of dentistry has provided optimal function and esthetics in order to create natural teeth for patients.\n\nThe procedure involves your dentist taking a 3-Dimensional (3D) digital impression of your mouth to measure the area where the crown will be placed - say goodbye to traditional impression material. Afterwards, a small camera is utilized to take high quality images of your teeth. Once finalized, the milling unit is used to create the ceramic crown. The dentist will then paint and glaze each tooth to match your other teeth perfectly. Bonding is the final stage of the procedure, which can be completed in a matter of minutes - creating a high quality and meticulously shaped crown that fits seamlessly with the rest of your teeth.\n<h2><strong>How long do CEREC Crowns last?</strong></h2>\nBoth types of crowns typically last 10-15 years. However, the lifespan of a crown largely depends on the patient\u2019s oral hygiene. Take good care of your mouth and crown and it can last much longer than 15 years.\n<h2><strong>Are CEREC Crowns more expensive?</strong></h2>\nAs with any dental procedure, your costs will vary.\n\nThe cost can be based on a number of factors, these include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The type of dental insurance you have.</li>\n \t<li>Procedures covered by your dental insurance.</li>\n</ul>\nProcopio Towle Dental Office accepts all PPO insurance programs, as long as they will allow you as a patient to choose any dentist to be your primary dental care provider without any obligation to see one of their dentists within their network.\n\nWe also provide an \u201cin-house\u201d Procopio Towle Annual Dental Membership for patients who are without dental insurance, it is a prepaid membership dental savings plan that delivers additional value by eliminating monthly premiums and deductibles. For new patients and current patients who do not have dental insurance, it provides an economical way to get dental comfort care they otherwise could not afford.\n<h2><strong>Are CEREC Crowns better than traditional Crowns?</strong></h2>\nCEREC crowns are more conservative on the tooth and more time efficient. Given that they only take a day to complete, these technologically advanced crowns, have become the preferred option.\n\nWhile it can take weeks to receive a traditional dental crown, a CEREC crown is created in a single appointment. Not only that, but they allow for a better bite and more natural teeth for patients. Rather than using an impression tray and material, which is uncomfortable and subject to minor distortion, we take photos of the tooth using a digital camera. The computer will create a 3D model of the tooth that is designed by your dentist as opposed to a Lab Technician, who is unfamiliar with your mouth. Once the tooth design is finalized, our milling machine will fabricate the crown from a ceramic block with exceptional accuracy, achieving both great fit and esthetics. They look extremely realistic and you do not have to wear a temporary crown or have uncomfortable impressions of your mouth taken.\n<h2><strong>Are CEREC Crowns good for molars?\u00a0</strong></h2>\nThe simple answer is YES!\n\nMolars typically do much of the hard work when breaking down food substances, making them susceptible to wear and tear. Consequently, a high-quality CEREC crown is always a good option for these types of teeth, if restorative options are needed. Obviously, these types of crowns work on any tooth and your dentist will provide the best option for you during consultation.\n\nMoreover, CEREC restorations are less reactive than gold and other metals. Therefore, patients are less likely to suffer from irritation, making it a safer choice.\n<h2><strong>Conclusion\u00a0</strong></h2>\nOverall, CEREC crowns are an innovative and highly efficient dental procedure that provides all the existing benefits of crowns and more!\n\nIf you are considering CEREC crowns or are still looking for options, call Procopio Towle Dental Office today, where we will be happy to help answer any inquiries you may have.',

  //     "As we know, respiratory infections increase this time of the year and COVID-19 further exacerbates and complicates \u201cflu season\u201d. Individuals with lower immune systems are more susceptible to these infections. The standard advice for the prevention of these illnesses is to wash your hands and keep your immune system healthy by eating properly and exercising regularly. Prevention advice for COVID-19 further includes six feet or more of social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and always wearing a face covering when around others. Although these practices are good ways of keeping hundreds of different bacteria and viruses from getting into your system, one lesser publicized approach to healthy living and avoiding a respiratory infection is to keep your teeth clean.\n\nPeriodontal (gum) disease is caused by plaque producing bacteria. The body releases what are called \u201ccytokines\u201d in order to defend itself against any type of infections such as periodontal infections. These cytokines trigger your body to constantly fight or defend themselves, thus weakening the body\u2019s immune system while fighting other infections. Symptoms of periodontal infection are often not noticeable until the disease is advanced. Some of the symptoms include bad breath that will not go away, red or swollen gums, tender or bleeding gums, loose teeth, or sensitive teeth. The American Academy of Periodontology has reported that, <em>\u201cBacteria that grow in the oral cavity can be aspirated into the lung to cause respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, especially in people with periodontal disease.\u201d</em> The bacteria that are multiplying in the mouth are not only being used as viral factories but are also being breathed into the lungs. Studies have shown that 85% of the population have some degree of periodontal disease and therefore it is extremely important to get regular dental checkups. A dentist can diagnose periodontal disease in the early stages during routine teeth checkups, prior to individuals realizing that they even have it. That is one of the reasons professional cleanings at a dental office are recommended every six months.\n\nSusceptible lung exposure is not the only part of your health that is connected to your oral health. It just so happens that this is a focus given these unprecedented times we are living in due to the attention being given to the COVID-19 pandemic. If left unchecked, poor oral health leading to increased bacteria in your mouth can also impact many other different systems in the body and be a factor in heart disease, dementia, and diabetic complications.\n\nBased on the health benefits of preventive dental care, we at Procopio Towle Dental Office in Walnut Creek dental office would like you to consider making your next appointment for your dental checkup and teeth cleaning. We are trying our best to do everything we can to be proactive in making sure you receive the dental care you need especially when there are known benefits to simple daily dental hygiene, routine teeth cleanings, and periodontal diagnosis by your dentist. We are also proud that due to our strict guidelines and protocols when visiting our dental office, no one in our office including patients, staff, hygienists, dental assistants, and doctors, has been infected or tested positive for COVID-19.\u00a0 Please consider making your next appointment now and every 6-months thereafter as another aspect to being as healthy as you can be.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Tiziana Procopio",

  //     '<h2><b>Invisalign Step-By-Step Procedure\u00a0</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While <a href="https://pwdds.com/invisalign/">Invisalign</a> may not seem like a fairly new procedure, and, instead, one that\u2019s been in the orthodontic toolbox for some time, the company itself is only 20 years old. Although, since gaining mainstream acceptance around 2004, with new innovative technology emerging within the field, the idea of clear, removable plastic trays to straighten your smiles now accounts for 6% of teen orthodontics and an impressive 31% of adult orthodontics.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s not at all a shock as to why such a phenomenon has become such a popular procedure within many dental practices across the globe - and particularly one here at Procopio Towle Dental Office, Invisible trays that are discreet, removable and pain-free? It\u2019s as if the orthodontic gods answered all our prayers.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, to shed light onto this popular dental procedure, here is a breakdown of the Invisalign procedure.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Consultation\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://pwdds.com/invisalign/">Invisalign procedure</a> often starts with an in-depth consultation with your Orthodontist or Invisalign Specialist. Asides from the clinical considerations based on a patient\'s overall health, at this stage we will determine whether a patient is able to keep their trays in for almost 24 hours a day and whether the likes of train tracks may be a more suitable option (particularly amongst children). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular method of realignment is not recommended for children as it requires regular compliance, and is, therefore, most commonly used for teenagers and adults. The best candidates for Invisalign are those with mild to moderate misalignment of the bite and dental arch that can easily be addressed with this treatment.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The consultation will also cover the overall cost of the dental procedure, as well as outlining any insurance coverage if required.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Creates an Invisalign Plan\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have all agreed that Invisalign treatment is a desirable option for you and your teeth, we take x-rays, photographs and impressions of your mouth. We will take </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">polyvinyl siloxane (PVS)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impressions and these record molds can be sent to the aligner tray laboratory, who then fabricate a series of aligners for the entire treatment. These are designed to fit precisely over the dental arch to straighten your teeth. Once <a href="https://pwdds.com/invisalign/">Invisalign</a> laboratories have utilized computers to create 3-D renderings of your teeth, this information is stored within our own dental office computers.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be a back and forth process between the office and laboratory regarding Invisalign adjustments until we are completely satisfied with the trays to then start the overall procedure. Perfection is key to much of our work.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Wait for your Aligners\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the tray aligners, it may take a month or so for them to be properly sculpted to fit your mouth. After that, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">each aligner tray is worn for approximately two weeks during which the next tray in the series is used. This sequence of trays may be anywhere from 8 trays to 48 trays, depending on the severity of the misalignment and the compliance by patients.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Wear Your Aligners\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Patients will come to our dental office in Walnut Creek when the aligners are ready, and we will give them to you. They are all different and are meant to be worn in a specific order. As aforementioned, each aligner should be used for two weeks.\u00a0 The number of aligners that you\u2019ll need will depend on how complex your treatment plan is. Usually, you\u2019ll have one aligner for every two weeks of treatment. It\u2019s imperative that you wear your retainers between 20 and 22 hours every day.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As your treatment progresses, each new aligner will serve to bring your teeth into straighter positions. You can take out an aligner to eat or brush, but otherwise, you should basically always be wearing one during the treatment process. If you don\u2019t, your teeth movements won\u2019t progress according to plan, and as you put in new aligners, they won\u2019t fit correctly.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Invisalign Refinements</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the last of your Invisalign trays have been worn for two weeks, you may have completed the whole teeth aligning process. Although, more often than not, a few teeth might still need some minor adjustments to create the perfect smile. Our dental specialists here at Procopio Towle Dental Office will inspect your teeth to assess the overall results. In some cases, we may create a few more \u201crefinement\u201d trays, if required.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level="1">\n<h2><b>Invisalign Retainers\u00a0</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your treatment is complete you\u2019ll be given</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> removable retainers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before you stop wearing your Invisalign braces we\u2019ll fit a discreet fixed retainer behind your teeth, which will permanently hold them in place. At the same time, we\u2019ll take impressions for a removable retainer, which will arrive back from our lab the following week. Your removable retainer will be very similar to your Invisalign aligners, but you will only need to wear it periodically at night.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that\u2019s it\u2026</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s a fairly straightforward, no-nonsense dental procedure that can bring amazing results, in a short and simple time frame.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>For more information, call Procopio Towle Dental Office<a href="tel:9259335677"> (925) 933-5677</a>, today to find out how we can help create the perfect smile for you.\u00a0</b>',

  //     '<b>What is Invisalign?\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign is a revolutionary system of the science of orthodontics to create clear plastic aligner trays to gently reposition teeth in a discreet yet affordable manner. Clear aligner trays are becoming one of the most popular ways to straighten your teeth. Dr. Jasmine Jenkins, our Invisalign Specialist, is excited to offer this treatment to teenagers and adults at Procopio Towle Dental Office.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide further insight into these highly popular and extremely effective dental services, we have compiled a list of the top 5 facts you NEED to know about Invisalign.\u00a0</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b> They are Removable</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional fixed and wired braces, Invisalign are removable. This allows you to take them off when you eat and/or drink. This removable element means that Invisalign does not interfere with your daily life, as you can enjoy all your favorite foods without worrying about anything getting stuck in your wires or brackets. This also means that your teeth will be cleaned and maintained effectively - in some cases more so than braces - as you can brush your teeth without having to maneuver around the metal brackets.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The removable aligners ensures you can adopt the best oral hygiene practices when not in use. Simply remove the aligner, use clear soap, and brush them in cold water. By rinsing thoroughly you will be able to remove any excess dirt accumulated throughout the day.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign is also perfect for people who play contact sports, especially those that require mouth guards. Simply remove the aligners while playing and replace them when you\u2019re done.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This adds convenience for many adults. There are no changes to your diet that need to be made while you are going through treatment. This is one of the main reasons why this style of aligners are recommended.</span>\n<ol start="2">\n \t<li><b> You Do Not Need a Specialist to Adjust Them</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With traditional braces, an Orthodontist will set appointments for you to come in and have the wires tightened and adjusted. However, with these clear aligners, you will have a short visit with our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign Specialist</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to check the progress of the aligners given to you and will simply give you the next 1-2 trays of aligners.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign aligners are virtually invisible, include no metal and are custom made for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teeth. They work in a series of trays that gradually shift your teeth into place. Each tray is manufactured so that the teeth are slightly straighter than the previous tray. Your teeth will typically move up to 0.25 mm per tray. Every two weeks, you will receive a new set, slowly moving your teeth towards their ideal positions.\u00a0</span>\n<ol start="3">\n \t<li><b> Invisalign is comfortable (more so than braces in some cases)</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients who opt for Invisalign articulate how comfortably they are in their mouth. Without the metal wire and just a removable, fitted thermoplastic aligner, patients find that Invisalign is a comfortable oral option that provides ultimate ease of use. There are no brackets that can create sores, which alleviates any mouth ulcers or cuts forming in your gums.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this increased level of comfort, Invisalign tends to be a popular choice among many adults. And with only 35% of adults\' front teeth aligned correctly, it\u2019s a no-brainer.</span>\n<ol start="4">\n \t<li><b> You have to wear them 22 Hours a Day\u00a0</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign must be worn a minimum of 22 hours per day. Typically, you are only supposed to remove them for eating and practicing daily oral hygiene. That means that if you are heading out for a date or going to a party, you will have to wear them! But remember, they are completely clear - so they often go undetected.\u00a0</span>\n<ol start="5">\n \t<li><b> Even our very own Dr. Procopio has had Invisalign\u00a0</b></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the phrase \u2018practice what you preach\u2019 definitely holds true here at Procopio Towle Dental Office. This year Dr. Procopio decided to receive Invisalign treatment by our very own specialists here in Walnut Creek. The results? A huge success. S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he loves how aligned her teeth have become, with minimal effort and pain. With the dentist and advanced technology doing all the hard work - all she had to do was wear her very own tray every two weeks for a perfect smile.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">All aligners are integral for the health and overall appearance of your teeth and thankfully here at Procopio Towle Dental Office, we provide a range of treatments that will provide you with a beautiful smile.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision for </span><a href="https://www.brightnow.com/orthodontist/invisalign"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisalign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over metal braces really comes down to you, the patient. Each patient\u2019s needs and preferences are unique and special. If the appearance of metal braces has been holding you back from a straighter smile, Invisalign could be a great option. This is especially true for teens that are perhaps self-conscious of wearing braces, or adults that need them later in life. Invisalign is often used for adults who didn\u2019t maintain their smile with a retainer when they had braces as a teen, or never got the chance to straighten their teeth to begin with.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are ready to achieve a beautiful, attractive smile, contact Procopio Towle Dental Office to </span><a href="tel:925-933-5677"><b>schedule a consultation</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visit with Dr. Jasmine Jenkins can work with you to determine if you are an appropriate candidate for treatment with Invisalign and can help get you started obtaining the smile you\u2019ve always wanted!</span>',

  //     '<h2><b>How to Manage Dentist Anxiety in Children</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><>Dentist Anxiety in Children</> - Dental fear and anxiety (DFA) is one of the major challenges in pediatric dentistry [1]. The prevalence i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ndeed, it is extremely common for children to be fearful or stressed when they have to visit the dentist. This pervasive problem can lead to deliberate avoidance of dental treatment, thereby having a negative effect on the child\u2019s orofacial and psychological health in the long-run.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, we have devised a list of top tips for managing children\'s dental anxiety, to help alleviate any psychological issues your child may be experiencing, with the overall aim of creating a positive experience for both you and your children when they visit their local dental practice.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Be Open and Honest With Your Kids</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the saying goes, \u2018honesty is the best policy\u2019. It is advantageous to be as honest with your children about dental procedures so that they are never caught off guard. It\u2019s natural to be fearful of the unknown, particularly when someone is pointing sharp equipment towards your mouth, so having full clarity about what is happening is key to resolving any emotional distress your child may be experiencing.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means then is when your children ask about the dentist, avoid illusive answers that will create an air of mystery (children can typically sense this). This may inadvertently have a negative impact on the way they approach the dentist, which may trickle into their adulthood; posing serious oral implications later on in life. Instead, reiterate the importance of regular dental check-ups and the benefit of seeking professional help for all their dental care needs!\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Try to Understand What Is Triggering Your Child\u2019s Fears</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad experiences in a dental practice will likely cultivate extreme Dentist Anxiety in Children. One of the best ways to combat these issues is to establish what exactly is triggering your child\u2019s fear. The most common issues are listed below;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Embarrassment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some children\u2019s oral health may have some glaringly obvious issues that are visible, such as tooth decay or dental deformities located at the front of their mouth. Such dental issues may strike fear of embarrassment amongst children; particularly if they have been susceptible to bullying as a result of this. Consequently, reassuring your children that the dental clinics are professionals who have seen a wide array of oral issues (many worse than the ones your child has), is a fruitful way of calming down their initial insecurities and will hopefully encourage them to be more relaxed.\u00a0</span>\n\n<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Top tip</strong>: Try to find a dental professional who will continue to communicate with your child during the procedure to help comfort them along the way.</span></em>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Needles or Injections.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trypanophobia is defined as an extreme fear of medical procedures involving injections or needles. According to a study reported by the US National Library of Medicine, up to 50 percent of children exhibit needle fear</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, knowing there is some pain associated with needles can be very scary for kids - particularly when it\'s within your mouth. However, if your child avoids needles or injections from a young age, this fear is likely to persist within their adult life - rendering long-term problems like avoiding the dentist (despite that persistent pain they are experiencing in their molars).</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The keynote to take about here is that dentists are professionals who know how to make an injection as painless as possible (I mean they did get a degree doing it). It\u2019s their job and so they have full experience and expertise within this matter.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oftentimes, it\u2019s best to keep the needle out of sight by asking the child to close their eyes before the injection is administered. Computerized injections are also a great option because they don\u2019t look like a traditional needle and can control the speed and pressure of the shot.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Anesthesia.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0Some patients are uncomfortable with the idea of being put to sleep and not being aware of what\u2019s going on while they\u2019re under. Others don\u2019t like having a mask on their face. The best approach is to be informative and explain exactly what the patient can expect. Taking it slow and sharing the details of the procedure ahead of time can go a long way in calming the patient. If the stress is severe, dentists should always opt to reschedule the procedure rather than forcing a child, which may amplify the fear even more.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fear of Pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing about painful experiences from other children or adults who\u2019ve had similar dental procedures, it\u2019s hard to not expect the same. However, most dental professionals are dedicated to making young patients as comfortable and confident as possible. Pain management is taken very seriously and, as always, everything should be explained to your kids, so they know what to expect before any procedure is started.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a clearer idea of what kind of fear your child is experiencing and what is triggering those particular feelings, it should be easier to address them and ease their anxiety.</span>\n\n<b>Find the Right Dentist for Your Child</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad experiences at the dentist can prompt Dentist Anxiety in your Children. In fact, studies taken place in the U.K revealed a clear correlation between negative interaction made by dental staff members and your children and their subsequent dental anxiety levels. This means that staff and dentists working within the practice have a very direct effect on the child\'s mental well being. Thus, the friendlier the receptionists and encouraging dental professionals, the better the child\'s overall experience at the dentist will be.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, it\u2019s essential to find the right dentist for your family\u2019s needs. Opting for a pediatric dentist or family dentistry is a fruitful way of preventing dental anxiety amongst your children. In order to do this, it would be advantageous to inquire as to what methods the dental practice use to help calm nerves and make every appointment a more positive experience. To help, here on some tips on how to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose the best dental plan for your family</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Practice, our patients are everything to us.\u00a0 Our aim is to provide a welcoming and inviting atmosphere for every patient who enters our practice, and helps them leave with a big, bright smile!\u00a0</span>',

  //     '<h1><b>Festive Foods: The Do\u2019s and Don\u2019t this Holiday Season\u00a0</b></h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christmas is right around the corner\u2026</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">That\u2019s right, it\'s that time of year again where we start celebrating. Typically, Christmas is synonymous with festive foods, drinks, friends, family, and of course, presents. However, given the current circumstances, a socially distanced celebration will likely be the reality for most of us this year.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, we may overcompensate for the \u201cunusual\u201d festive period this year. As lockdown restrictions inhibit non-distanced socializing, excess Christmas decorations and overindulging in food is the most likely scenario for homes all across the nation. While we embrace this with open arms given the year we\u2019ve had, it\'s important that we are mindful of our dental health over the holidays. Some foods that we eat over Christmas have great nutritional value, but some are terrible perpetrators for plaque. In this article, we will discuss the good and bad types of festive food and drinks, to help you make conscious decisions about your oral health.\u00a0</span>\n<h2><b>What food are BAD for your oral health\u00a0</b></h2>\n<b>Chocolate and Sweets\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know Christmas would not be Christmas without candy. It\u2019s almost impossible to think about the festive season without chocolate and sweets. However, their overall effect on your oral health is extremely damaging, should you choose to consume excessive amounts on a continuous basis.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chocolate and sweets both contain high volumes of sugar; the tooth\'s biggest enemy. Typically, both of these food substances deliver high doses of sugar into the mouth, which cultivates bacterial growth, plaque, and gum disease. Bacteria in the mouth turns sugar into acids, which eats away at the surface of your teeth, rendering decay and cavities over time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We acknowledge that chocolate is such a HUGE part of Christmas, so we\u2019re not saying to completely refrain from eating ANY chocolates. However, be cautious when consuming such products to avoid unwanted trips to the dentist in the new year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes our mouths between 20 minutes and 2 hours to re-balance the decay-causing acids which are produced by eating sugars; therefore, grazing on sweet treats keeps the teeth under constant attack.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Tip: if you\u2019re going to eat chocolate, keep consumption to a minimum as opposed to continued binging over the holidays. If you are going to eat any, then it may be best to do it after a meal, when your teeth are already being challenged with acids from your normal diet. Afterward, Brush for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste to help protect the teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Toffees / Candy\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of food products are a dentists worst nightmare. It\'s sugar, sticky and hard. Indeed, their texture makes them one of the most damaging desserts to your teeth. Their hard exterior can render a cracked or chipped tooth, unless you softly suck away at the sweetie for a prolonged period of time until it reduces in size. However, this still has a drastic impact on your oral health, as the longer your teeth are exposed to the candy, the more sugar and acid available to attack your tooth\u2019s enamel. Again, keep consumption to a minimum for healthy teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Dried Fruit</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dried fruit features in a lot of our festive food products such as mince pies, Christmas cake and Christmas pudding. All of this may seem like a healthier option, given that it is of course \u2018fruit\u2019. Contrary to popular beliefs, however, these types of food products are extremely high in sugar. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sugar content high in these foods, but these sweets can also get stuck in between your teeth or even cause damage to dental appliances or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth fillings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u00a0</span>\n<h2><b>What Foods and Drinks are GOOD for you</b></h2>\n<b>Cheese\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may not be the best for the waistline, but it is for your teeth?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For all those cheese lovers out there, you will be happy to know that cheese is great for your teeth. The high calcium content in most cheese products ensures that your teeth will remain strong and healthy. There\u2019s also studies that stipulate eating cheese after a meal is a great way to neutralize the acidity levels in your mouth, so get your cheese boards out this festive season.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Milk\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to that of cheese, milk comes packed with calcium and has a neutral acidity level. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u00a0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking milk makes your teeth stronger and protects tooth enamel. It also strengthens your jaw bone, which can help you keep your natural teeth longer, and fights tooth decay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Almonds\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuts, especially almonds, are a good option for your teeth. They are a great choice for snacking because they are high in protein and calcium but low in fat and sugar. Make sure you choose the natural kind and not the sugared or honey-roasted as you snack this festive season.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Practice, we care about your teeth. We understand that you may want to indulge in some delicious and rich food products, but make sure that you think about the overall welfare of your teeth during the holidays. No one wants to have to check-in at the dentist in the new year for some fillings, sealants, dentures or crowns as a result of sugary snacks.\u00a0</span>\n<h2></h2>',

  //     '<h1><b>Top 3 Benefits of a Local Dentist near you</b></h1>\n<h3><b>Looking for a local dentist near you?\u00a0</b></h3>\n<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your teeth have a huge impact on both your physical and mental health.\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, over 80% of Americans [1] don\u2019t like the way their teeth look. This dislike of their teeth gives these people lower self-esteem, which can lead to a lower quality of life [2].\u00a0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why regular visits to the dentist\u2019s office should be a top priority. And if you want the best care possible, a local dentist is a fruitful way of receiving top-quality dental treatments on your doorstep. In order to shed further light on this, we have compiled a list of the 3 MAJOR benefits that a local dentist can offer.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h2><b>A Local Dentist Builds Personal Relationships</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that dental service organizations and corporate or chain dentistry are in a growth phase. Most of them are based on a low-fee, high-volume model. They generally accept all of the reduced-fee plans in their areas. Many of the doctors do not have an ownership stake in these offices, which leads to more turnover, meaning patients may not see the same doctor from one visit to the next. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, they have to treat several patients at the same time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some patients do not mind these types of dental systems, many individuals really struggle to find this type of model sustainable. One of their main concerns is the dentist\'s inability to get to know them on a personal level. It can be terrifying enough to have scary machinery inserted in your mouth; particularly so if the person who\u2019s doing it is a complete stranger.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, this structure necessitates a large turnover of patients daily, leaving you susceptible to rushed treatment, which may render an erroneous diagnosis, or hurried poor-quality dental care.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the majority of cases, this doesn\u2019t happen with local dentists.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local dentists function differently from those corporate models. Whether big or small inside, the dentists are part of the community and often take the time to build a personal relationship with you. - well that\u2019s what we do here in Walnut Creek. This helps us understand your oral health needs so we can recommend the best treatment for you (and your budget).\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This personable and intimate local relationship enables </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">each member of your family to feel comfortable with the care being provided to them. This makes it easier to express any concerns that may arise in the future. Plus, it makes it easier for your kids to visit the dentist. They won\u2019t be afraid of the dentist. You\u2019ll trust that they are in good hands and they won\u2019t feel any sort of panic when they hop into the dental chair.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h2><b>Top Quality Dental Treatment</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local dentists tend to provide a higher quality of oral care.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, they care about you. For us, dental treatment is about more than making a living. It\u2019s about keeping your teeth healthy and your smile confident. On top of that, local dentists have a reputation to uphold. Over 85% of local businesses get a large portion of their customers through word of mouth. That means local dentists are more motivated to ensure you have a good experience with them.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it\u2019s going the extra mile to get to know you and your family, or recommending the most affordable but highly effective dental treatments - local dentists care about YOU and your teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we like to ensure you\u2019re completely comfortable every time you sit down in the dentist\u2019s chair. Whether you\u2019re receiving dental implants in walnut creek, top quality cosmetic treatments, or just a standard check-up procedure, we take the time to explain every step of the process so you know what to expect. Our dentists are in no hurry to get you in and out as quickly as possible. Instead, high quality is an integral asset to our dental clinic - which often necessitates time and meticulous attention to detail with each patient to ensure a seamless procedure.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have the majority of all dental treatments and procedures in-house, for both adults and children, meaning you can come to one key location in Walnut Creek to receive top-quality dental care.\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h2><b>Patient Reviews You Can Trust</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you schedule a first appointment with any dentist, it\u2019s a good idea to ask them for referrals. These referrals will be able to tell you what type of experience they had with the dentist.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And when it comes to a local dentist, these referrals are easy to find and even easier to trust.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They are the people in your community. You probably know many of them already. They could be your acquaintances, your friends, and even your family. This ensures you can trust your dentist to take care of your teeth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If it\u2019s not word of mouth, a great source of information is online on the likes of Google, where you will have access to a range of reviews from patients who have received local dental services. At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we keep our online referrals updated by our clients and respond to all the comments to provide comprehensive insight into how our practice functions. It is of the utmost importance for both our customers to voice their experience with our dentists, as well as us to see their feedback - whether it\u2019s positive or negative.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For any dental procedure here in Walnut Creek, call our office today to book in with one of our specialists. We are here to help make your smile as beautiful as possible.\u00a0</span>\n<h2></h2>',

  //     '<h2><b>\u201cTo chew or not to chew, that is the question?\u201d</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it was the Northern Europeans chewing birch bark tar 9,000 years ago to satisfy their mouths and provide some much needed medicinal tooth relief, or the Maya civilization chomping on sapodilla trees to quench their thirst and/or hunger. Chewing gum has stood the test of time and has been a stable part of human life, distracting the jaw and curating bone movement in the mouth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, like most things in life, not all chewing gum was created equally. While western civilization has moved far away from utilizing leaves as gum, nowadays, there are clear distinctions between the good kinds and bad kinds for our teeth.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some may seem self-explanatory, but you would be surprised by how many people don\u2019t even realize the negative implications caused by excessive chomping on those soft, cohesive substances that are so addictive and tasty!\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide further insight into this common dilemma, we have provided some \u2018extra\u2019 tips on what chewing is good, bad, and terrible for your teeth. Our blog discusses what types of chewy condiments you should avoid, and which ones are fine to consume; leaving your mouth in \u2018mint\u2019 condition.\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b>THE BAD KIND OF CHEWING GUM\u00a0</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, the bad type of chewing gum is the one that contains sugar.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, non-sugar free chewing gum contains sucrose. Sucrose and other fermentable carbohydrates can be metabolized by oral bacteria. The problem with this type of gum is that they can produce substances such as dental biofilm (a type of fungi in the mouth) and acid, which can lead to enamel erosion and cavities. The negative effects of these types of chewing gum is entirely dependent upon how much chewing gum is consumed and how long for, as well as the sequence of consumption. For example, chewing sugar-containing gum before eating food that reduces acid production will be less damaging than the reverse.\u00a0</span>\n\n<img class="wp-image-4382 aligncenter" src="https://pwdds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chewingum-1-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="333" />\n<h3><b>THE GOOD KIND OF CHEWING GUM</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is compelling evidence to suggest that sugary chewing gum cultivates the onset of bacteria and cavities in your mouth, the opposite can be said for sugar-free chewing gum.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugarless gum has been shown to have an array of oral health benefits that can prevent tooth decay. Studies have shown that chewing sugar-free gum after meals and snacks can help remove and/or neutralize the acids released by bacteria in plaque (a harmful and extremely damaging substance to most tooth enamel). The act of chewing gum stimulates the salivary glands in your mouth. Saliva neutralizes and washes away the acids in your mouth that are produced by broken down foods. By washing away this acid, you are protecting your enamel. So when you chew gum after a meal, you\u2019re helping propagate the acid-cleaning saliva that plays an important part in your oral health</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is predicted that the average unstimulated salivary flow rate for healthy people is 0.3-0.4 mL/min. When chewing unflavored gum, you stimulate the salivary flow rate by 10-12 times that of the unstimulated rate. Flavors also act as salivary stimulants. The stimulated salivary flow rate is significantly greater while chewing sweetened and flavored gum as opposed to unsweetened, unflavored chewing gum base.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulated saliva flow provides protection against dental erosion via several mechanisms. Saliva buffers the effects of acids in foods or drinks that could otherwise soften teeth\u2019s enamel surface, and swallowing excess saliva created by stimulation clears acid. While unstimulated saliva does not have a strong buffering capacity against acid, stimulated saliva has higher concentrations of total protein, sodium, total calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate and therefore has a higher buffering capacity. Additionally, saliva contributes proteins to dental surfaces and helps to carry more phosphorus and calcium around your mouth, creating an acquired enamel pellicle that protects against dental erosion.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We would also advise that if you do chew gum, opt for s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ugar-free gum sweetened with xylitol, which has the added benefit of inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus mutans, one of the oral bacteria that cause cavities.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we would advise that you refrain from eating lots of chewing gum on a continuous basis. Indeed, excessive chewing gum can sometimes lead to wider health problems in general. For example, excess chomping - typically in times of high stress- can lead to temporomandibular joint dysfunction. This symptom can greatly affect the jaw, jaw joint and surrounding muscles leading to severe pain any time you attempt to move your jaw away from its typical alignment.\u00a0</span>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><b>To Chew or Not to Chew?\u00a0</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand it can be a habit to pick up a piece of gum and start chewing. In most cases, it feels completely innocent. But there are some negative associations with sugary chewing gums that are filled with additives that will stimulate bacteria in your mouth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although chewing sugar-free gum can be beneficial in most instances, there are some cases in which chewing gum is not recommended. For example, if you are experiencing any type of jaw pain or temporomandibular disorder symptoms (TMD/TMJ), you should refrain from chewing gum and talk to your dentist about what options are available to you.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our professional opinion, it is completely fine to chew gum. However, this is entirely dependent upon the type of gum you choose.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugarless gum is strongly advised, particularly after you\u2019ve eaten. In fact, even the American dental association recommends chewing gum after your meal to reduce plaque and increase saliva flow around your mouth - fighting off bacteria and tooth decay. However, avoid sugary chewing gums that will coat your teeth with sucrose and lead to the erosion of tooth enamel, causing cavities and erosion over time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on dental hygiene and top tips from our experts, call one of our friendly staff today. We are more than happy to provide insight into what foods are GOOD for your teeth, as well as ones that should be avoided</span>',

  //     '<h1>5 simple tricks to scare cavities away during Halloween</h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween is right around the corner, an event that is associated with copious amounts of candy and additives that are renowned for their ability to cause tooth decay.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, we are NOT here to tell you to refrain from eating these sugary condiments that bring much joy and happiness for many kids; an asset that is desperately needed during these rather unprecedented times. However, we are here to provide advice on how to alleviate the negative oral effects prototypical of excessive candy consumption!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand this year\u2019s Halloween will be very different from previous years. Shelter in place across California (and the US in general), has meant that children can\u2019t go out and get bucket-full of candy from neighbors. But, this does have an advantage for your children\'s oral health. When purchasing your own candy to compensate for the shelter-in-place, you can be in charge of what your children eat, and you also have the ability to teach them very important oral tips that will be indispensable in later life.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To shed light on this, we have compiled a list of top tips for combatting candy during this Halloween, that will help scare cavities away while still allowing you to enjoy those mouthwatering goodies.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><b>1) Don\u2019t deprive your kids of candy</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rule number 1. Do not deprive your children of eating candy. I know we should probably not be saying this as dentists, but this short-term cavity combative measure could lead to more serious problems in the future. Deprival can send the wrong message entirely and make them crave those sugary foods more in the future. They may even sneak a few when there\u2019s no one watching! -</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, it may be a fruitful idea to get your children to pick their top 10 (or however many you decide) of their favorite snacks. The remaining candy you have can be hidden away or donated to a food bank. They may want to pick hard sweets, soft sweets, chocolate, and even pretzels as their Halloween treats! This is a useful lesson to showcase to them that there is an array of snacks that are bad for their oral hygiene, not just excessive sugary candy.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Allowing children to pick their favorite snacks will teach them that \u2018candy is not bad\u2019, but as the saying goes \u2018everything in moderation\u2019. Too much will lead to cavities, but having a few snacks here and there, particularly during Halloween, is completely fine!&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><b>2) Choose Candy Wisely</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite allowing children to pick the snacks they want out of their goodie bags (refer to point 1), as a parent, you still have the ability to choose which candy you can provide to your children. Unlike your usual assortment of Halloween candy bags, COVID-19 has immersed us all into this unique environment where we can pick and purchase the candy for our children. So choose wisely!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all candies are created equal. On a scale of worst to best, gummies, lollipops, and caramels are by far the most damaging to children\u2019s teeth. This is because the frequency of exposure is more harmful in most cases than quantity. Lollipops and gummies are high in glucose and last for prolonged periods of time on your teeth. The sugar will wear down the enamel on your teeth and the frequency of exposure increases the chance of harm. If presenting your children with any of these types of sweets, make sure they brush their teeth after finishing them to remove any plaque deposits.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Better treats are typically chocolate, the best of which is dark chocolate, whose cocoa beans are known for their antibacterial compounds that can fight bacteria in the mouth.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><b>3)&nbsp; Set a Treat Time&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be a fruitful idea to set a treat time during the Halloween period. This could be a schedule that lasts beyond Halloween and thus teaches your kids some valuable lessons:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaches children that excess candy consumption is not tolerated and moderation is essential for oral and general health</span></li>\n \t<li>Makes kids less inclined to snack throughout the day if they have a dedicated time to consume goodies</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>4) Set up a brushing schedule</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what time it is, it is crucial to brush your children\u2019s teeth after they have been eating candy.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some foods and drinks, particularly those high in carbohydrates and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sugars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can stimulate the growth of oral bacteria that attack your tooth enamel. By brushing your teeth after you eat, you reduce this bacteria and help protect your enamel from damage.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluoride </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mouth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rinses for kids also help prevent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decay, according to the American Dental Association.</span>\n<h3><b>5) Drink water and limit other sugars.&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next few weeks (or months even with Christmas on the horizon), candy is going to become a frequent sighting in many homes across America. For this reason, we would also recommend increasing the amount of water your children consume and reducing the number of sugars they have in other foods - particularly sugary drinks. Water has the benefit of washing away leftover food and residue that cavity-causing bacteria love to eat. It prevents bacteria from deteriorating your teeth - maintaining good oral health for your children.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that\u2019s it. There are our fang-tastic tips for combatting scary Halloween cavities that are likely to ensure if you don\u2019t adhere to good oral hygiene practices.</span>',

  //     '<h1>All You Need To Know About CEREC Crown</h1>\n<h3><b>What are same day crowns?&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">CEREC crowns are a dental restorations that can be completed within the same day! This means, you can simply walk into the practice with your teeth and walk out with a brand-new and healthy crown!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, just because they are completed quickly, at Procopio Towle Dental Office, we do not compromise on quality. The same-day crowns are the same as our usual crown procedures, but they\u2019re ready in a couple of hours as opposed to a few weeks!&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a useful procedure for all our patients, as it mitigates any inconvenience caused by multiple trips to the dentist - saving you time and money. It\u2019s also fruitful in our current climate, with COVID-19 causing much fear amongst those at large to leave their homes and risk infection. Only one trip to the dentist can make you feel slightly more relaxed!&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>How are CEREC Crowns Placed?&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To start the CEREC crown procedures, we take an examination on your mouth to determine whether this procedure is the best option for you. Once you and the dentist have reached a conclusion about whether the CEREC crowns are suitable for you, we will start preparing the tooth, taking a scan, milling the crown and fitting it - all completed within the space of a couple of hours.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional crowns, which comprise 3 main materials; porcelain, metal and porcelain fused to metal, single day crowns are made of ceramic. Utilizing innovation CAD-CAM technology, our dentists ensure that we achieve the perfect fit with your new crowns, making them look as natural as possible.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of a computer, we can create a digital 3D image of your tooth and crown with precise measurements, mirroring that of your typical tooth/ crown procedures. Once the final design is complete, a milling machine carves a replica of the design to make a crown out of a single ceramic block. The milling process takes approximately 15-20 minutes and another 10 minutes to glaze, heat and polish the CEREC crown. Afterwards, the CEREC crown will be cemented and if required, a dentist will make minor adjustments for the perfect fit.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process, your teeth may need to be numbed and contoured in order to fit the crowns. However, we will work closely with you and address any concerns you may have regarding local anesthetic. Gentle dentistry is our specialty here at Procopio Towle Dental Office.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Advantages of CEREC Crowns</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of benefits associated with same-day crown dental procedures. These include;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-effective: You no longer need to book several appointments and wait a few weeks to see a dentist (potentially longer given the current COVID-19 crisis). You can have a new crown sculpted and contoured within a few hours!&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost-effective: You can save money on appointment costs and take less time off work&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comfortable: these dental procedures are as comfortable as your usual crowns, and you do not need an impression to have one rendered</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoring your looks quickly: as you have a perfect smile back within a few hours</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoids the need for temporary crowns which are renowned for their uncomfortable nature and inability to stick to the mouth. Preventing decay: dislodged temporary crowns may make room for decay&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoring functionality immediately: teeth alter your speech, smile and eating patterns. Same day crowns restore all these functions instantaneously.</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;',

  //     '<h1><b>What Is The Importance of Regular Teeth Cleaning?</b></h1>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">With COVID-19 stopping all but emergency dentist appointments, your regular oral hygiene checks came to a halt!</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, it is&nbsp;<strong>now&nbsp;</strong>the right time to get your teeth cleaned.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dentists are not just for keeping your teeth bright; they have a direct and significant impact on your general health. Bad oral hygiene has been linked to serious, and in some cases, life threatening diseases such as strokes and cancer (for more information visit the&nbsp;importance&nbsp;of regular checkups blog).</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">While maintaining good dental hygiene (brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing) is&nbsp;important, having an expert to inspect your teeth can help in numerous ways. In fact, your teeth may look and feel healthy, but there may be underlying issues that only a dentist can detect. Regular dental checkups and cleaning procedures can mitigate any problems you may have, or just provide that additional reassurance that your teeth are healthy.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">To provide further insight into teeth cleaning benefits, here are a list of reasons why professional cleaning is essential. These include:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Prevent gum disease</strong></h3>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Regular teeth cleanings can help prevent the onset of periodontal disease, an inflammation of the gums, typically caused as a result of poor brushing and flossing habits.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">As our mouths are full of bacteria, along with mucus and other oral particles, plaque can form on the teeth. Subsequently, brushing and flossing daily can help prevent plaque from forming on tooth enamel. However, plaque that is not removed can harden and form tartar. Only a professional cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist can remove this from forming on the teeth.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, a dentist can examine your gums when cleaning your teeth and detect any signs of inflammation. They may use a tiny ruler called a probe to check for and measure any pockets around the teeth, with a healthy mouth containing a pocket depth of around 1 to 3 millimeters. Without seeking professional cleaning, tartar and plague could go undetected, resulting in gum disease, which can lead to complications.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Removes stains that dull or discolor teeth&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your smile is&nbsp;important. In fact, it is the first thing someone notices when they speak to you. Consequently, having discolored or stained teeth can severely affect your confidence, preventing you from showing them off in social situations.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">A dentist can restore that confidence and provide you with a cleaner smile. They do this in a safe and cautious manner, unlike home whitening remedies which may damage your teeth and harm tooth enamel.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>They are covered</strong></h3>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many dental plans cover regular cleanings as it is in the insurers\u2019 interests for their patients to have their oral health looked after, to prevent future expensive dental treatments.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although, even without dental insurance, a professional clean is not an expensive procedure, particularly in comparison to other cosmetic treatments. You will also benefit in the long run from both a financial and health perspective by receiving cleaning treatments. Here at Procopio Towle Dental Office, we offer our annual <em>In-House Dental Membership</em>, for those who do not have dental insurance. Our&nbsp;<em>In-House Dental Membership&nbsp;</em>is a prepaid membership dental savings plan. Click here to for more details on our&nbsp;<em>In-House Dental Membership.</em></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a patient\'s oral health will differ from one another. Factors such as genetics, diets and lifestyle play a fundamental role in the overall well-being of your teeth. A dentist or a hygienist can provide you with a personalized plan on how to maintain good oral habits after the procedure, so that you can have a healthier and brighter smile for a prolonged period of time.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Procopio Towle Dental Office at <a href="tel:(925) 933-5677">(925) 933-5677</a>.</strong></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>',

Consequently, having missing or decaying teeth can seriously affect your confidence and overall self-esteem.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmetic dentures are thus a perfect way to restore your smile and overall confidence, in a cost-effective and non time intensive manner.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of this, we understand that you may be seeking additional information regarding the process of getting dentures, which is why we\u2019re providing this step-by-step guide, so you know what to expect at each stage of the process.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>What are <a href="https://pwdds.com/dentures/">dentures?</a></b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dentures are replacements for missing teeth that can be taken out and put back into your mouth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike implants, dentures do not look and feel exactly the same as your natural teeth, but their appearance and function have been developed extensively over the past decade to make them look and feel better than ever.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main types of dentures: full and partial. Your dentist will help you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> choose the type of denture that works best for you based on whether you are needing a small or larger proportion of your teeth replaced.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Full denture:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A full denture is placed over your mouth after remaining teeth are removed and tissues have healed.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Partial Denture:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A partial denture rests on a metal framework that attaches to your natural teeth, serving as an anchor for the dentures.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>The Denture Procedural Process:\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">How does the denture process work?\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Consultation\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process starts with a consultation, where your dentist will examine your bone structure, gum tissues and existing teeth. They may also take an X-ray of your mouth to determine what type of dentures you need, whether partial or full.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dentist will then take an impression of your mouth as well as measurements of your facial contours and features of your mouth too.</span>\n\n<b>Initial Fitting\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the impressions have been complete, the dentures are then made. During the initial fitting you will get the opportunity for the dentures to be set in a wax base and then inserted in your mouth to examine how the dentures fit and their overall aesthetic.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you and the dentist have approved the overall design, they can be fitted into their final acrylic base to make them look as naturalistic as possible.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Final Fitting\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the final fitting, the dentist will analyze the overall fit of the dentures in your mouth and their comfort with the additional acrylic base. This is the opportunity for you to retest the comfort of the dentures and decide whether any adjustments need to be made. It must be noted that the dentures will feel strange at first and may take some time to get used to.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>How long do dentures last?\u00a0</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, the lifespan of dentures is around 5-7 years. These cosmetic procedures will need to be remade and relined due to normal wear over a period of time.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your dentures will also need to be rebased, which involves a dentist creating a new base, whilst still keeping the existing dentures within your mouth.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you age, your mouth naturally changes, causing the dentures to loosen, making chewing difficult and irritating to your gums. It is therefore imperative that you visit your dentists for regular check ups to ensure your teeth are in a healthy and hygienic condition, to safeguard you from any possible irregularities with these cosmetic procedures.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Top Tips for caring for your dentures</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visiting the dentist is integral for the overall maintenance of <a href="https://pwdds.com/dentures/">dentures</a>, however there are also a range of things you can do to keep your dentures in the best possible condition. These include;\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing over a towel or basin of water when handling dentures. They can be extremely delicate and may break if dropped.\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your dentures moisturized at all times. You can do this by placing them in a cleanser soaking solution or in water when you\u2019re not wearing them. However, never use hot water - this can warp the dentures making them unusable.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brushing your dentures daily. This will remove food products and plaque - maintaining an overall clean and healthy aesthetic.\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brushing your gums, tongue and plate every morning too. This will stimulate circulation in your tissues and help remove plaque.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information regarding our denture procedures, visit our <a href="https://pwdds.com/dentures/">dentures pages</a> or alternatively call Procopio Towle Dental Office at <a href="tel:9259335677">(925) 933-5677</a>. </span>',

  //     '<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last <a href="https://pwdds.com/benefits-of-dental-implants/">Dental Implant</a> blog post, we discussed the benefits associated with this dental procedure and their ability to improve facial structure, food habits, overall dental health - and of course their natural and long-lasting oral effect.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it can be an extremely daunting process to go through a dental procedure for many patients. In fact, it is estimated that nearly <a href="https://www.gentledental-mi.com/overcoming-dentophobia-a-fear-of-the-dentist/">75% of adults in the United States</a> experience some amount of fear with regards to visiting a dentist. Of that percentage, about 5%-10% of those people have a strong enough fear to be considered sufferers of dental phobia.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, understanding how the dental implant process </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">works </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is of paramount importance for many patients. In order to provide further insight, we have provided an overview of the <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-implants/">Dental Implant</a> process.</span>\n<h2><b>Overview of Dental Implants</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly is dental implant surgery?&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental implant surgery is a procedure in which a dentist replaces your tooth roots with artificial ones.&nbsp; Dental implants are typically a comfortable alternative to dentures or bridgeworks which are renowned for their uncomfortable nature.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">How dental implant surgery is performed is highly dependent upon the type of implant that is required and it is different for each individual patient. Factors such as the condition of your jawbone can mean you have to have several procedures in order to get the implants fitted (more info in section 2)</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As dental implants provide a solid support for your teeth - a major benefit of the procedure - their process requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant. Due to this, the process can take several months to complete.&nbsp;</span>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Stage</b></td>\n<td><b>Duration</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consultation and Treatment Plan</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to a weeks to Schedule&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extractions</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks on average and up to 10 days healing</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone Grafting</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Might take up to a few weeks to schedule and can include up to 12 months of healing&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implant placement</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of hours&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osseointegration</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> months for your lower jawbone and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> months for your upper jawbone&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healing Collar</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 days</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abutment Placement</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 weeks of healing</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temporary Crown</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 weeks while the permanent one is being made</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Tooth&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 dental visits</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-Procedure</span></td>\n<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few days to heal, check up weeks after the final procedure&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><b>Consultation and Treatment Plan&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to getting a dental implant is a consultation. This process may involve an X-ray and/or teeth impressions.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your medical history is likely to be reviewed at this point to highlight whether you have any underlying health problems which could pose a risk during your surgery.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this is complete, a treatment plan can be devised. You will be informed about what is going to happen during each step of the way and how you should prepare for the Implants procedure.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Associated Procedures&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may need to receive additional procedures in the process of getting dental implants. The most common is bone grafting and tooth extractions.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you still have a tooth where the implant is due to be inserted, then an extraction will be required. This is a fairly simple procedure taking no more than 30 minutes to complete.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also need bone grafting which is a more complex process. This procedure involves thickening the jawbone if it is too thin or soft to support implants. The procedure involves sourcing the bone tissue from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a tissue bank that prepares bone from a cadaver. The graft does not have cells and works as a scaffold allowing the patient\u2019s bone to regrow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This process can take anywhere between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4-6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> months, which means your implant can only be inserted after this period.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Dental Implant Surgery&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the dental implant surgery itself, the dentist will normally use a local injection</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to numb your mouth and ensure the process is as pain-free as possible.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step will involve a dentist making a small incision within your mouth, to enable the metal implant to be inserted in the appropriate position.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Osseointegration</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the surgery is complete, the next stage of the dental implant procedure is known as osseointegration. </span>\n\nOsseointegration refers to the process of the bond between the physical bone and the surface of the artificial tooth replacement - the dental implant.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This process can take on average anywhere between 3 to 6 months.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this stage passes, you will receive a healing collar - which is basically a piece of metal that prevents your gums from growing over the implant. These remain on your teeth for a 2 week period.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Abutment Placement&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step of the implant process is abutment placement. Abutments have the main benefit of cultivating gum healing around the implant and are usually made of titanium or zirconia.&nbsp; These dental connectors can be applied at the same time or after the implant placement procedure. You will be advised on when this will occur during your consultation.&nbsp;</span>\n<h2><b>Dental Implant Procedure</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The final stage of the dental implant procedure involves the placing of the crown or bridge. Once your gums have fully healed, the dentist will insert a naturally looking prosthetic tooth in your gum to create a natural and seamless finish.</span>\n\nDr. Procopio is a specialist in Dental Implants and has extensive knowledge and experience of these specific procedures. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of Implants are also now more affordable. </span>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Our single implant procedure price cost ranges between $3,000-$6,000. I</em><em>f you have insurance, we will have to verify, if implant is a covered benefit.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<i>Call Procopio Towle Dental Office and schedule your Free Implant Consultation and Complimentary X-Rays.</i>',

  //     '<h1>Fillings and Sealants: What\'s the difference?</h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings/">Dental fillings</a> and <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-sealant-benefits-causes-and-side-effects/">dental sealants</a> are two entirely different procedures. While they are both quick cosmetic treatments (take less than half an hour, on average) and both seem to coat or shield the teeth, their materials, purpose, and longevity differ in a number of ways. To make the process clearer, here is a list of the major differences between the two. </span>\n<h2><b>Restorative Versus Preventive</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of dental sealants and fillings are one of the major distinctions between the two cosmetic treatments. Fillings are considered a restorative application used on teeth that have been damaged by decay. When a dentist gives you a filling, they will remove the decayed material, clean the affected area and then fill the cleaned out cavity with filling material (for more information, visit our dental fillings blog here). Sealants, on the other hand, are deemed \u2018preventative\u2019. A sealant will be used by a dentist to cover a portion of a tooth to prevent damage from occurring. </span>\n<h3>Dental Fillings</h3>\nA dentist will use a filling to restore a tooth after a cavity or a hole has formed in your mouth from tooth decay.\n\nTooth decay is usually a result of dental plaque which turns sugar into acid. Subsequently, the oral acids in your mouth dissolve the minerals which make up the enamel, such as calcium. This will cause the enamel to weaken, usually evident through discolouration of the tooth, whereby holes or cavities will form in the material.\n\nA filling is therefore inserted into the tooth to prevent any additional damage, with its sole purpose to block the entry of oral bacteria that could result in an infection or even greater decay to the affected tooth. For more information, review our <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings/">dental fillings blog</a>.\n<h3>Dental Sealants</h3>\nConversely, sealants are deemed as a \'preventative\' dental procedure.\n\nIndeed, a sealant can be applied to a tooth which has not suffered any decay. Sealants essentially prevent tooth decay from forming on the pits and fissures of the teeth, providing a physical barricade to protect the natural tooths surfaces and grooves - the perfecting breeding ground for decay to form. Thus, dental sealants shield teeth from the early onset of decay before its too late.\n<h3>Permanent Vs Temporary</h3>\nAnother distinction between the two dental procedures is their longevity. Whilst both sealants and fillings are considered permanent treatments, it is fillings that usually last longer. Sealants, on the other hand, are regarded as temporary dental procedures - which is why they are often used on children!\n<h3>Dental Fillings</h3>\nOn average, dental fillings usually last around 10-15 years. A filling replacement is a fairly rare procedure, as the materials are durable and withstand food supplements and bite resistance.\n<h3>Dental Sealants</h3>\nDental sealants can usually last up t0 10 years without needing a replacement fitted. However, regular check-ups are required to ensure the materials have not chipped or worn away. Although, these dental procedures can be easily replaced by a hygienist who can add more sealant material if required.\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information about dental fillings and sealants, contact Procopio Towle Dental Office at <a href="tel:9259335677">(925) 933-5677</a> to schedule a Consultation or visit our <a href="https://pwdds.com/services/">dental services page</a>.</span>',

  //     '<h2>Dental Fillings</h2>\nDental Fillings are one of the most popular dental procedures to have. In fact, it is stipulated that the average American will get fillings at <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160927143042.htm">least 3 times</a> in heir lifetime.\n\n<strong>So what are they?</strong>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;"><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings-procedures-in-walnut-creek/">Dental Fillings</a> are a restorative treatment that repairs the damage of tooth decay. Dentists \u201cfill the hole\u201d that has been created by the decay. The decay is removed prior to the actual placement of material. Fillings are made from a composite (tooth-colored) material or amalgam (silver) material. Composite is the newer and preferred material due to cosmetic reasons. An anesthetic gel is applied to the area where an injection of local anesthetic is given. The injection then numbs the tooth so the patient does not feel any discomfort during treatment. The dentist then removes any previous dental restoration and the surrounding decay. The cavity is cleaned prior to the material being applied. Similar to the sealant process, the material is hardened using an ultraviolet light. After the material has hardened, the bite is adjusted and corrected using a handpiece.</p>\n\n<h3>Benefits of Dental Fillings</h3>\n<b><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings-procedures-in-walnut-creek/">Dental filling</a> treatments provide a number of benefits, including;\u00a0</b>\n\n<b>Quick procedure: <span style="font-weight: 400;">When only one tooth is affected by decay, the filling treatment is a quick and uncomplicated process that roughly lasts about an hour-long</span></b>\n\n<b>Durable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental fillings can last on average around five-seven years on average - particularly tooth-colored fillings. White silver fillings usually have a longer life span and can last for around 12 years (on the premise that you maintain good oral hygiene)</span>\n\n<b>Cost-effective: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental fillings are a fairly economical dental procedure - particularly if you are covered by dental insurance.</span>\n\n<b>Appearance: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, dental fillings are a fairly undetected dental treatment - particularly if you opt for a tooth-colored filling restoration!</span></b>\n<h3>Dental Fillings risks and side effects</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Side effects posed by the implementation of a filling are fairly few and far between. However, as with any treatment, patients may experience side effects. These include;\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Sensitivity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some patients may experience sensitivity prior to receiving a filling around the infected area. If you are experiencing sensitivity, it is advisable that you avoid hot or cold drinks during this time to mitigate any pain.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Pain:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some patients may also detect pain when biting down or applying pressure to the treated tooth the following days after the procedure.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>Re-treatment:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> As the dentists permanently remove damaged areas of your natural teeth and fill it in with a synthetic material, you will have to return to the dentist five-twelve years after the first procedure.\u00a0</span></b>\n<h3>How are Dental Sealants and Dental Fillings Different?</h3>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Although they are similarly performed, they are very different. The main differences come from the goals of the treatments, longevity, and the amount of modification to the actual tooth. The average life of a filling can be expected to last as long as ten years. The average life expectancy of a sealant is no longer than a year. Depending on the patient\u2019s oral hygiene practices, it may not even survive that long. Sealants are typically provided to children to protect their back teeth from developing decay, whereas fillings can be provided throughout one\u2019s lifetime to restore a tooth from decay that has already formed. During a filling, unlike a sealant, the natural tooth structure is modified due to the removal of the decay. A sealant only fills in the natural grooves of the tooth.</p>\nTo find out more about our dental procedures and services, visit <a href="https://pwdds.com/services/">our dental services</a> page now!',

  //     '<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal is a term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the root canal which is where the tooth\u2019s nerves reside.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Procopio Towel Dental Office, our experienced dentists are specialists in saving your natural teeth using advanced technologies to treat you quickly and comfortably.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Step-By-Step Process of Root Canal Treatment</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A root canal treatment is used to repair and save an infected or decaying tooth. During the root canal procedure, a dentist will remove the nerve and pulp, afterwards cleaning the inside of the tooth. Once the cleaning process is complete, the tooth will then be sealed to begin the healing process.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin the root canal treatment, our endodontist will numb the infected or damaged tooth using local anesthesia&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will then insert a small shield to isolate the tooth - keeping it clean and dry</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An opening is then made through the crown of the tooth and into the chamber&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fluid is put into the canals to kill any bacteria and to rinse out debris&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, the pulp is removed. Utilizing small instruments, our endodontist carefully cleans and shapes the canals&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After space has been appropriately manipulated, the endodontist fills and seals the root canals. A temporary filling is often incorporated to protect the outer layer of your tooth and allow it to heal from the infection</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If necessary, you must return to your dentist to have your tooth properly restored with a filling or crown to protect the tooth for any future infections&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Signs that warrant a return trip to the dentist</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Common symptoms and signs associations with root canal infections include;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Pain or discomfort - <span style="font-weight: 400;">ranging from mild tenderness to unbearable pain, especially when you apply pressure from eating or pressing on the tooth, or expose the tooth to extreme temperatures (i.e., consuming cold or hot drinks)</span></b></li>\n \t<li>Red, warm or swollen tissues <span style="font-weight: 400;">near or surrounding the tooth, especially the gums. In some cases, swelling can also affect your face and neck too.</span></li>\n \t<li><b>Tenderness or discomfort in swollen tissues,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially when you touch or apply pressure to it.</span></li>\n \t<li><b>A bad taste in your mouth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a bad smell permeating from your breath caused from the infected tissues&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>What causes root canal infections after treatment?&nbsp;</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons why a tooth can have an infection after a root canal. These include:&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shape of your root canals can be very complicated and areas of infection may go undetected in the first procedure</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tooth could have narrow or curved canals that weren\u2019t fully cleaned and disinfected during the root canal&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tooth may also have additional accessory canals that could be housing bacteria which may reinfect a tooth&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the placement of the crown or permanent restoration is delayed following treatment, it could allow harmful bacteria back into your tooth&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tooth may get a new cavity after treatment, or become cracked or damaged, leading to a new root canal infection&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits of Root Canal Treatment</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many clinical reasons for needing root canal treatment, but there are also countless practical reasons as to why saving your natural tooth is a beneficial choice for your overall dental wellbeing. Endodontic treatment helps you maintain your natural smile whilst continuing to enjoy the foods you love the most. With professional care, root canal treatments can also last a lifetime. The main benefits associated with root canal treatment, i</span>t stops the spread of infection to neighboring teeth.\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major benefits associated with root canal treatment is its ability to prevent the spread of infection within the mouth. As outlined in the treatment section, root canal procedures involve the removal of bacteria from the tooth. Once the bacteria is removed, the tooth is often cleaned and disinfected to prevent toothache or decay. After the infected tooth has been treated, there is no room for the bacteria to spread, ultimately safeguarding you from multiple dental trips and costly repairs to your teeth.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Root canal treatment has a naturalistic result&nbsp;</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal therapy involves the treatment of the tooth pulp or nerve and finishing it with a </span><a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-fillings-procedures-in-walnut-creek/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crown or a dental filling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The treated tooth is sealed with a tooth-colored filling or crown that provides a new and beautiful appearance.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we provide quality root canal treatment that restores both the functionality and the aesthetic of your teeth.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>It prevents the jawbone to degenerate</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal treatment also has the ability to preserve teeth. Because of this, you are able to avoid the degeneration of your jawbone - a damaging side effect associated with the loss of a tooth or teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bones are strengthened by a physical stimulus. For your jawbone, that includes the force exerted on your jaws by chewing and biting and the way those forces travel through your teeth. When a tooth is missing, the bone loses its stimulus in that spot and your body begins signaling osteoclasts to break down the jawbone. New bones are still being formed, but at a lower rate than bone that is being destroyed. Consequently, fixing the decay or infection during a root canal treatment and preserving the tooth facilitates the continuation of movement in your mouth - ultimately stimulating the bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>It enhances oral and overall health&nbsp;</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe tooth decay can greatly affect the overall oral health of an individual and pose greater health implications beyond the mouth. It is widely regarded that tooth decay can cultivate the early onset of heart diseases, diabetes, and respiratory infections - which in some cases can result in death (for more information check out our blog on gum disease and the importance of routine checkups).&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Virtually pain-free procedure&nbsp;</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal treatment is virtually a painless process and often leaves you with less discomfort during recovery than if you have your natural tooth extracted. Our dentists here at Procopio Towle Dental Office utilizes modern techniques, advanced technologies, and effective anesthesia to create a comfortable treatment.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Tips for preventing root canal infections</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several preventative steps that you can take to stop a root canal infection, which involves taking care of your teeth after the procedure:&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brush and floss at least twice a day&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a gentle, antiseptic mouthwash for the first few days after a root canal. Use it as often as you\u2019d like afterward, too&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use an over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen for soreness after treatment&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return to your dentist for a final crown or permanent restoration as soon as possible. This will seal the root canal from bacteria and protect your tooth</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get dental cleanings at least twice a year to keep your teeth generally healthy and catch decay or infection early&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See your dentist right away if you notice any early signs of infection&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>',

  //     '<h1><b>Dental Sealants</b></h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the regular routine check-ups, At Procopio Towle Dental Practice we offer a wide range of treatments and procedures for our patients. A particularly popular and common treatment we provide, especially amongst children, are dental sealants.</span>\n<h2><b>All About Dental Sealants&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental sealants are a preventative treatment applied to premolars and molars with deep crevices to protect against the development of decay.&nbsp; Deep pits and fissures are the source of over 80% of tooth cavities, which is primarily due to food and bacterial plaque lodged in between tight crevices on your teeth that are often inaccessible with brush bristles. Subsequently, plaque acids and enzymes at the base of these grooves cause the tooth enamel to dissolve, eventually rendering cavities in your mouth.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, many attempts to stop pit and fissure tooth decay have been made...&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fistulotomy (prophylactic odontology) is a particular procedure that aims to prevent the onset of tooth decay. This treatment involves funneling the grooves open with a cone-shaped dental tool.&nbsp; If done early enough on a groove that does not extend through the dentin layer, it may be possible to perform just this type of dental procedure. However,&nbsp; more often than not, the deepest pits and fissures do often extend beyond the dentin layer and this procedure must be followed by placement of a filling of some type.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The grooves can also be cleaned out less invasively with a micro abrasion handpiece, which sprays a stream of abrasive particles deep into the seams of the pits and fissures to remove plague bacteria and roughen the enamel surface. Although, as micro abrasion preparation doesn\u2019t completely eliminate plaque in the deep narrow crevices, it is usually followed by placement of a dental sealant.</span>\n<h2><b>How are Dental Sealants applied&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying dental sealants is a fairly simple and painless process. It only takes a few minutes for our dentist or hygienists to apply the sealant to seal each tooth. The application steps are as follows:&nbsp;</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, the affected tooth that requires a dental filling is cleaned thoroughly prior to manipulation&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tooth is then isolated from all mouth moisture and the grooves are etched with a mild acid solution. This produces a microscopically roughened surface into which the sealant will adhere.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teeth are then rinsed and dried</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sealant is then applied to the gloves as a viscous liquid, which hardens on its own or by exposure to a blue light.&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once placed, the sealant prevents bulk plaque from being able to accumulate in the pits and fissures.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Benefits of Dental Sealants&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many benefits to sealant treatment. Most often sealants are used in children, but adults with decay can benefit from sealants as well. Overall;&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants protect the grooves of the teeth from food particles.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are easy to apply and are a quick treatment</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protection of teeth begins immediately after application.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants can last several years before a reapplication is needed.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are more affordable and are a proactive way to help prevent cavities.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are white or clear in color, making them virtually invisible when talking, smiling or eating.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants are suitable for children too</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Side Effects of Dental Sealants&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sealants have some potential downsides. It is possible for micro leakage to occur along with the sealant - especially if moisture is present when the sealant is placed. If leakage does occur, it may be difficult to detect until a large cavity develops beneath the sealant.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It\'s important that patients are reminded that sealed teeth are not completely resistant to tooth decay. It\'s a big mistake to relax nutrition and oral hygiene standards on the belief that sealants alone will prevent cavities. Remember to see a dentist regularly to have the sealants evaluated for signs of failure. Left alone, a poorly contoured failing sealant is at least as prone to decay as an unsealed tooth.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Practice, our dentists </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are professionally skilled in performing a variety of dental filling and sealant services. Cosmetic dentistry is very personal and individualized for each patient. We understand that the appearance of your smile can have a dramatic impact on your confidence, image, overall appearance, relationships, and human interactions.</span>\n\n&nbsp;',

  //     '<h1>Dental Crowns: Procedures, Materials, and Implications</h1>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you missing a tooth? Or do you have problems with your existing dental restorations?&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well the chances are you have questions, and, with social distancing measures in place, you may be finding it difficult to get answers to the various queries and grievances you are currently facing. Indeed, with most dental practices only accepting those patients deemed \u2018dental emergencies\u2019, you may be putting various dental plans you had in mind to the bottom of your agenda. However, we want to remind you that this time in lockdown may in fact be a propitious time to plan ahead and be prepared for when restrictions are eased.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to help you with this, we have taken the liberty to provide you with further insight into one of our most popular dental procedures - <a href="https://pwdds.com/crowns-bridges/">dental crowns</a>; detailing what they are, how they function and why they are a prosperous and cost-effective dental service.</span>\n<h3>What is a Dental Crown?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A dental crown is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-shaped "cap" that is placed over a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cover the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to restore its shape and size, strength, and improve its appearance. A crown may be appropriate for a large area of decay or breakage when the remaining tooth structure is not sufficient to support a filling.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Why Is a Dental Crown Needed?</h3>\n<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://pwdds.com/crowns-bridges/">dental crown</a> may be needed in the following situations:</span></h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect a weak tooth (for instance, from decay) from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To restore an already </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broken tooth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a tooth that has been severely worn down.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there is not a lot of tooth left.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To hold a dental bridge in place.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cover misshapen or severely discolored teeth.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cover a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dental implant</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make a cosmetic modification.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restore Confidence and Self-Esteem.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Types of Dental Crowns</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold \u2013 A biocompatible noble metal. This is a good choice for molar restorations subjected to a great deal of bite force.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Metal crowns withstand biting and chewing forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down. Also, metal crowns rarely chip or break and are a particularly popular choice for out-of-sight molars. However, the metallic color and the costly replacement of gold&nbsp;is the main drawback for this particular type of dental crown.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stainless steel \u2013 These economical dental crowns are sometimes used on children\u2019s baby teeth.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stainless steel crowns are \u201cprefabricated crowns\u201d that are used and fused on permanent teeth covering the entire tooth and protecting it for further decay. However, stainless steel dental implants are typically utilized as a temporary measure. Its main purpose is to protect the tooth or filling whilst a dentist creates a specific dental crown made from a different material. The major benefit of stainless-steel dental crowns is that they are suitable for children - primarily due to the fact that they do not require multiple trips to the dentist and are thus a more cost-effective solution for dental health!&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porcelain \u2013 The most aesthetic option, a porcelain crown blends beautifully with natural teeth. This type may be made of solid ceramic, or porcelain fused to a metal core.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">All-ceramic or all-porcelain dental crowns provide better natural color match than any other crown type and may be more suitable for people with metal allergies. Porcelain dental crowns have the added benefit of matching your existing teeth (unlike metal crowns), to the extent that they are almost unrecognizable to the naked eye. Typically, these types of dental crowns are a good choice for teeth positioned in the front of the mouth, as well as long bridges where the metal is needed for strength. Although porcelain crowns do not contain metal, these types of dental crowns are vulnerable to additional wear and tear compared to other materials.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>What Problems Could Develop with Dental Crowns?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A problem that may develop with dental crowns often involves sensitivity immediately after the procedure has taken place and any anesthetics have worn off. If the tooth that has been crowned still has a nerve it in, you may experience some cold or heat sensitivity - in this case, we would advise you to veer away from hot or cold (fizzy drinks). We would also advise you to incorporate a toothpaste such as Sensodyne which contains potassium nitrate which aims to soothe the nerves inside your teeth from feeling pain from triggers. Although, all of these problems are fairly common and generally nothing to worry about. We would only advise you to seek further dental help if, when you bite down on your crown, you are experiencing discomfort. In the case, it is probably because the dental crown is too high on the tooth and will, therefore, need fixing by your dentist.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Can You Have an Allergic Reaction to Dental Crowns?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you can have an allergic reaction to dental crowns due to the mixture of metals utilized within the crown itself. However, this is extremely rare. As a dental practice, we go through extensive measures prior to any of our procedures to safeguard our patients from irregularities. Your health and safety is a priority to us.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that even if you do have metal allergies you are still able to have dental crowns, albeit those without metal fillings such as porcelain.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Does a Crowned Tooth Require Special Care?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always practice good oral hygiene and brush your teeth at least twice a day. Just because a tooth is crowned, it does not mean that the tooth is protected from decay or gum disease. We would advise you to floss your teeth as well -- particularly around the crown area where the gum meets the tooth.</span>\n<h3>How long do Dental Crowns Last?<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, dental crowns last between five to fifteen years. The lifespan of a crown depends on the amount of wear and tear the crown takes, how well you follow good oral hygiene practices and your personal mouth-related habits. By grinding your teeth or chomping on hard objects your Dental Crowns may be susceptible to chips.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>How Much Do Dental Crowns Cost?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs of crowns vary depending on what part of the country you live in and on the type of crown selected (for example, porcelain crowns are typically more expensive than gold crowns, which are typically more expensive than porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns). Generally, crowns can range in cost from $800.00 to $1,700.00 or more per crown. A portion of the cost of crowns is generally covered by insurance. To be certain, check with your dental insurance company.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, we accept all PPO insurance programs, as long as they will allow you as a patient to choose any dentist to be your primary dental care provider without any obligation to see one of their dentists within their network. We also offer \u201cin-house\u201d Procopio Towle Annual Dental Membership for patients who are without dental insurance. Our prepaid dental membership savings plan that delivers additional value by eliminating monthly premiums and deductibles.

  //     '<h3>What is a Family Dentist?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A family dentist is a dentist that performs dental services for patients of all ages\u2014from toddlers to adults. Unlike some dentists that can perform pediatric services but prefer not to, family dentists regularly help both adults and children with their family dentistry needs. This extra practice makes them a preferable choice to a dentist that prefers adults but may work on kids if requested. So, from toddlers just getting their first tooth to senior citizens who might benefit from tooth replacement - a family dentist can assist with all types of oral services you and your family may require.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst registering with a family dentist provides a range of benefits for you and your family, we have outlined the top 4 benefits that you may have otherwise overlooked...</span>\n<h3>1)Track your family\'s Dental health</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically at family dentists, we can keep track of your family\u2019s dental as well as overall general health. Remaining at the same practice and forging a relationship with your dentist enables us to trace any genetic dental problems in your family and prevent them before they can cause any serious problems - meaning nothing can fall through the cracks when you are under the care of a family dentist. Consequently, combative methods can be put in place before it\'s too late!</span>\n<h3>2) Convenient and Comfortable Dental Services</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply, family dentists are convenient and comfortable. Instead of having to register each individual family member to different dentists, you can all be seen under the same roof. You can schedule appointments that enable all your family to be seen on the same day - saving you the time, effort, and money of making multiple trips.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the common dental anxiety many patients suffer from can be alleviated at a family dentistry. Generally, the close-knit, friendly environment generates a more relaxed and soothing scenario than your prototypical gloomy dental practice. If parents have also been going to a particular practice for years, you\u2019ll have a sense of familiarity and comfort with your dentist. Some dental procedures are painful as it is, so knowing your surroundings is an integral element to ensure a safe and seamless service.</span>\n<h3>3) All-round Dental Care</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our family dentists have vast experience in treating all sorts of dental problems. Again, family dentists will take care of all your dental requirements under one roof. Whether you are seeking teeth whitening services, dental implants or just routine check-ups, you and your family will be able to visit just one practice and leave smiling confidently and content.</span>\n<h3>4) Setting a good example for your children</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting an example and demonstrating to your children how important the dentist is for your general well-being and oral health is a major benefit of a family dentistry. If your family all attend different dentist practices, chances are your children will not see you sitting in a dental chair and having your teeth examined. Thus, family dentists naturally set a precedent for your children to take care of their teeth and seek dental care into their adult life.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>Why Dr. Procopio\u2019s Dental Practice?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr Procopio strives to maintain good oral hygiene by welcoming you into a friendly, family atmosphere for all your dental requirements. Our family dentists perform the same services that adult and pediatric dentists perform including;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanings and checkups&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placement of fillings&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root canal therapy&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmetic Services and much more&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, family dentistry means bringing top-quality care to you and those you love in the Walnut Creek area, please call <a href="tel:9259335677">(925) 933-5677</a> or </span><a href="tel:9259335677"><b>click here to request an appointment</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>',

  //     "<em>Dr. Wolter shared a YouTube link with me years ago that he had posted which was filmed by him in the early sixties. It depicted the neighborhood around Newell Avenue, and Chris on what I think was a motor scooter. Over time I lost the link, and it would be great if anyone in his family or some acquaintance might have the link to share. Hope this helps, and I too miss him. ~Richard G.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Dear Dr. Procopio, Has it really been a year? Time goes by so quickly. I just want to compliment you on your beautifully written email regarding his passing. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with all of us who knew him and loved him. If you would like to post my thoughts, I would like to add:&nbsp;When&nbsp;Dr. Wolter was with you he&nbsp;had a way of&nbsp;making you feel like you were his most important patient. He was kind and gentle while taking care of your dental work&nbsp;and was always excited to show off his latest electronic gadget. I always had to clear my calendar for a hour or more when I saw him as he wanted to share stories about flying somewhere or show off aerial photos his took or talk&nbsp;baseball. A few Saturdays I came by and we listened to old games he had taped from years past.&nbsp;Dr. Wolter was my dentist for 30 years and I know he is truly missed by all of us who were lucky enough to know him and call him a friend as well. ~Annina P.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Wow\u2763\ufe0f What wonderful memories I have of Dr. Wolter on San Miguel Drive. &nbsp;A coworker referred me to him when I was working in Pleasant Hill. &nbsp;My memory fails me as to what year that was but it\u2019s been a very very long time ago. I\u2019m not sure how long he\u2019d been in practice but I immediately liked him. His girls were very small (probably just babies). He was a doting father. &nbsp;I followed him when he moved the practice to Olympic Boulevard. He introduced me to sealants. It\u2019s been 20+ (or more) years since I\u2019ve had a cavity. LOL.&nbsp;What impressed me so much about him was that he really loved the profession that he was in. He loved people. He also loved keeping up with the latest technology and wanted to pass that on to his patients. My after-cleaning visit with him was always so very special. We talked like old friends about whatever there was to talk about i.e., the Giants, flying and last place visited, my vacation and last place visited, newest dental procedure, etc. Every 4-5 months or so we just sort of picked up where we left off. Like good friends do. \u263a\ufe0fYes, he\u2019s deeply missed but never ever forgotten. ~Michele Y. S.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I became one of Dr. Wolter\u2019s patients in \u201895. I always looked forward to my visits because whether there to see Chris, one of the other dentists or just a routine cleaning, he and I would spend time talking about two of our in-common life interests, photography and flying. He also taught me a good deal about the art and science of dentistry. Sometimes we talked for a good deal of time, raising havoc with the office schedule as Dr. P, or another dentist, and an assistant would be waiting to perform a mundane procedure such as a crown or implant. Everyone happily waited while Chris and I talked about and showed off photos and told stories of flying, (I am not a pilot but have spent considerable time flying in all kinds of aircraft. In a previous life I was a photo journalist.) I did get to go flying with Chris, it was great. I was also impressed with the way he handled his illness, he spent time explaining to me the entire situation, how he was handling it all and with his usual good humor and realistic approach. I do miss my favorite DDS. I was in the office numerous times during the months leading up to his death but I was out of the country at the time of his services. Thank you for giving me a chance to share this.&nbsp; I recall sometime around 2004 - 2005, I had been having trouble with a molar, it became abscessed and was causing great pain resulting in a Saturday evening call to Chris moaning about a prescription. The result was me meeting Chris at the office early Sunday morning, just me, my wife, our Bichon Frise and Chris, more talk about all sorts of things...and a successful root canal. ~Best Regards,&nbsp;Milt S.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Hi Dr. Procopio-Towle. I\u2019ll remember Chris as passionate about his work, patients, flying, art, family, sports. One of the things I\u2019ll miss is the opportunity to attend a Oakland Raiders or A\u2019s game with him. We spoke about it, but could not get it together.&nbsp;He was proud of his Reggie Jackson MVP trophy that was pulled from a fire. He loved to show that off.&nbsp; We had good laughs about it. I\u2019m glad I have his Oakland Coliseum image in my office. Thank you for making that available to me.&nbsp;He loved deploying technology. Remember the patient goggles he had? I think you could watch news and videos. &nbsp;And, the 3D crown building machine. I\u2019m glad to have used them. We\u2019ve lost a local treasure. ~Thanks for doing this, Jordon B.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I was so sorry to hear of Dr. &nbsp;Wolter\u2019s &nbsp;passing.&nbsp; My husband and I had been patients of his for so many years.&nbsp; I had particularly difficult dental problems and he provided the most wonderful, caring direction and techniques to help me through some otherwise stressful times.&nbsp; I recall one evening many, &nbsp;many years ago, while we were leaving for a party on a Saturday night.&nbsp; A temporary tooth had come out.&nbsp; I called Dr. Wolter and he met me at his office and repaired the tooth; I never forgot his kindness.&nbsp; &nbsp;My husband as well enjoyed his friendship; my hubs took him to a 49er game that year.&nbsp; He was a very personable and caring man. ~Julianne B.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Dr. Wolter was a good person and a true professional. I enjoyed our conversations and it was always so apparent that he enjoyed flying. My true regret is that our talked about flight around Columbia, Ca never worked out because of our schedules. I do know that God will take care of him and that he\u2019s probably flying around in the clouds now. ~Roger H.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>He was such a kind man!&nbsp;I always felt like I was in good hands with him, he always made me feel good coming and going from his practice.&nbsp;He is missed and will never find another Dentist like him.&nbsp;He was a pioneer and great man.&nbsp;Rest In Peace \ud83d\ude4f ~Lauren L.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Drs. Procopio and Wolter,&nbsp;We truly appreciate your email and reminder though difficult to accept that a full year has passed since Dr. Wolter passed away.&nbsp;Where should I begin we lived just down the block on Olympic Blvd., close to Dr. Wolter's office in 1991 this is where our family started&nbsp;being patients/customers of his practice. To this day we remain patients/customers now of Dr. Procopio Wolter's dental office.&nbsp;&nbsp;We lived in the Peninsula San Mateo for a while and we would commute to his office for our dental treatments and check up annually.&nbsp;His office and staff always made it possible for us to have the time and day available to commute from the Peninsula to come over see him when we needed to be seen.&nbsp;There are so many stories of him and his kindness and graciousness towards our family I can only imagine to how many other patients&nbsp;he extended the same this is how he was caring, conservative and always with a positive and encouraging outlook on our dental issues&nbsp;or matters that we would have.&nbsp;There will never be another Dr. Wolter he was one of a kind human being we were very fortunate to known him and have had such a caring and kind dentist to take care of our dental needs for our family we were his patients for over 29 years.&nbsp;We look forward to Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle and her staff to continue to carry forward the dental practice that he built of quality dental&nbsp;services for everyone and carry on his legacy.&nbsp;Thank you for the opportunity to express some kind words about Dr. Wolter and the person that he was besides being a dentist to our family since I personally do not do Facebook. ~Alvaro S.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Dr. Procopio Towle,&nbsp;Thank you for the lovely remembrance of Dr. Wolter. He was my dentist for 30 years and always gave me the very best of care and excellence in all my dental needs. I still think of him fondly. ~Best, Kendall L.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Going back 40 years there are a lot of shared memories with Chris and our families doing things together, especially in the early 80's. Here is one that is less than 10 years old (I think)\u2026.&nbsp; Since I have known him (somewhere around 1980) Chris was always trying to keep in the forefront of technology and gadgets.&nbsp; I remember when he purchased one of his first drones with video camera attachment.&nbsp; He could not wait for me to finish getting my cleaning done so that we could go out into the parking lot, get the drone out of the trunk and get it up in the air. &nbsp;We probably flew that thing for 10 minutes, going over traffic and homes, using the camera to get a real \u201cbirds eye view\u201d of the neighborhood.&nbsp; He had an excitement that was infectious and really enjoyable to experience and share\ud83d\ude09 take care\u2026 ~Art H.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>Hi Dr. Thanks for including my wife and I on your mailing list in remembrance of Dr. Walters. He became our family Dentist when my Family and I moved from upstate New York&nbsp;&nbsp;to California in 1984. We all looked forward to his kindness, honesty, and overall warm personality whenever we chatted with him during our dental appointments. I felt honored to have been his Father's replacement in the EBMUD Accounting Department when he retired from the Water Organization. We chatted and and laughed about \"how small\" the world can be at times in that I was now a patient for his Father's son. Thank you again for the remembrance reminder&nbsp; relative to this wonderful man. Hope You and your Dental Staff stay safe and healthy during this Pandemic COVID-19 time period. Love to you all! ~Paul and Phyllis R.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I first met Dr. Chris in 1976 when he started his dental practice at the his Ridgecrest office in Walnut Creek CA on San Miguel. We were both 27 years old. We loved Chris so much as he cared for me (Karen) &amp; my husband Jim &amp; our daughters Keely &amp; Koreen over many years. Keely was only 3 years old when she first met Chris &amp; Koreen was also 3 when she first met him. Now they are 46 &amp; 42 years old. Chris changed my life a few years ago when he gave me lumineers for a whole better look of my teeth &amp; smile I was proud of. When Chis passed last year we were both 70 &amp; had been dentist &amp; patient for 43 years! A &nbsp;Remarkable history which I treasure! &nbsp;I miss him so much &amp; am thankful that Dr. Procopio has carried on Chris\u2019s great tradition in the footsteps of his dentistry! ~Karen N.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>You can bet he's giving a 'Fly Over' to his and all FRONT LINE workers! ~Robert M. &amp; Family</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>\"After I wrote to Dr. Wolter complementing his photo of his blue and gold macaw, he mailed me two feathers explaining that held up to the light, reveals a brilliant blue on one side and a shimmering gold on the opposite side. He included photos of him swimming with his macaw in his pool. The feathers and photos are posted on my memory bulletin board.A lovely, kind and thoughtful man.\" ~Diana G.</em>\n\n*********\n\n<em>\"Dr. Wolter had a wonderful presence and I think his joy permeated the entire office. &nbsp;I really enjoyed the 15 years we had together and will always remember his kindness.\" ~Kathy D.</em>\n\n*********\n\n<em>\"Dr. Wolter is truly missed. He was my dentist from 2002 until his death.&nbsp; Rest in heaven Dr. Wolter\" ~Janet E.</em>\n\n*********\n\n<em>\"Dr. Wolter was my dentist from 1985 until his passing.&nbsp; He was an excellent dentist and a good man.&nbsp; He is greatly missed.\" ~Margaret W.</em>\n\n**********\n\n<em>I was a patient and friend of&nbsp; Dr. Wolter for 30+ years. He was a friendly, creative, very competent man. We would chit chat about various things and being appx. the same age, we'd cover baby boomer stuff like the 60's, the Beatles, etc. He always had&nbsp; ideas on how to work on my various dental issues and solved a lot of tough problems. I still have a plan he worked out for me posted on my refrigerator.&nbsp;</em><em>I had hoped that he would beat the cancer but alas...&nbsp;</em><em>He is missed. My condolences to all of you who worked with him and loved him.&nbsp;</em><em>Regards,&nbsp;Dennis K.</em>",

  //     'Due to COVID-19, only patients deemed as emergencies will be able to receive dental care during this self-isolation period (see emergency dentist blog for more information). If you do not qualify as an emergency patient but are experiencing tooth pain, there are a few steps you can take to help reduce irritation.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to help manage pain from teeth, gums, ulcers, and/or broken teeth until you visit our dental practice.\n<h3>How to manage pain from teeth while self-isolating?</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Anti Inflammatory Tablets</span></li>\n</ul>\nAnti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, and generic) and Naproxen (Aleve and generic) work particularly well against dental pain because they reduce inflammation in the traumatized areas of your mouth. Although, despite there being no definitive evidence that Ibuprofen exacerbates Coronavirus conditions, experts have recommended <a href="https://www.justonenorfolk.nhs.uk/covid-19-coronavirus-faqs/covid-19-ibuprofen-use" rel="nofollow">refraining from taking the anti-inflammatory drug</a>. So, Naproxen is probably best if you have experienced any symptoms. It is imperative that you do not exceed the recommended dosage.\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize Desensitizing toothpaste</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating desensitizing toothpaste \u200bsuch as Sensodyne repair can be a fruitful measure to combat tooth pain. Toothpaste such as Sensodyne work in two distinctive ways. Firstly, it builds a protective layer over the sensitive areas and it also assists with the removal of plaque bacteria to generate good oral health. In turn, this may help combat any irritation or pain you are experiencing whilst isolating.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Anesthetic Gel on Infected Area</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anesthetic gels are another short-term preventative step in combating tooth-pain without seeking dental care. They tend to provide fast-acting pain relief to patient discomfort. The anesthetic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gel should be applied directly to the affected area. Use the smallest amount necessary to relieve pain and use it no more than the number of times recommended daily. For an adult, product </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">labels generally recommend using only small amounts, at most 4 times daily, for a maximum of 7 days. For infants under one year of age, as little as \u00bc teaspoon of 7.5% gel (100mg).&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your head elevated to Reduce Toothache</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping at night may be extremely discomforting with a throbbing pain in your mouth. A tip would be to keep your head elevated at night when you lie down to go to sleep. Find an agreeable position in bed, which will reduce the blood pressure in your head - decreasing the overall pain in your mouth. An extra pillow can help keep your head elevated when you sleep.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>\u200b </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinse Mouth with Salt and Hot Water</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinsing your mouth with salt and hot water can help to reduce inflammation in your mouth and fight bacteria by creating an acidic environment. The mixture of salt and hot water can help to neutralize the acids in the throat that is produced by bacteria, maintaining an overall healthy pH balance. It can also help to dislodge bits of stuck food that may be causing pain, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping you to alleviate irritation and inflammation in your mouth.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a Cold Compress&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A cold compress can help reduce pain you may be experiencing in your mouth by restricting blood flow to the injured area, subsequently reducing swelling and irritation.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<em><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Never put heat externally on your face as this can draw the \u200binfection into the tissues in your face rendering swellings.</span></em>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid specific food and drinks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may already have some food aversions due to the pain you are experiencing currently. However, it is imperative that the foods and drinks you do take are neither too hot, cold, acidic, or sugary to ward off any additional pain in your mouth. It is advisable to avoid citrus fruits and juices, salty or spicy foods, and acidic foods like tomatoes. Do not drink carbonated or caffeinated drinks and refrain from consuming beer, wine, liquor, or any other type of alcohol.</span>\n<h3>How to manage pain from gums while self-isolating?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is bacteria or food debris trapped between the gum and the tooth, this can cause pain.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean the area &amp; rinse thoroughly&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, it is essential that you practice good oral hygiene, particularly if you have toothache. Make sure to brush at least twice a day with a sensitive toothpaste and ensure your mouth is thoroughly clean.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3>How to manage pain from ulcers while self-isolating?</h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst Mouth ulcers are common and caused by a number of factors, in some cases, it can be a sign of underlying medical conditions. You are advised to seek dental care if you have an ulcer that has not healed in over two weeks.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce the discomfort, you can try:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anaesthetic gel such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orajel,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bonjela or Anbesol</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To help with the healing of ulcers, you can try:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply Gengigel - can be effective as well as in soothing the pain</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinsing the mouth with salt and hot water</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms which are causing mouth pain, please call our dental practice immediately!&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A broken or knocked-out tooth \u2013 we recommend that you rinse the mouth with warm water to keep the area clean and put a cold compress on the face to reduce swelling. Immediately contact our office.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objects caught between teeth \u2013 we recommend that you gently try and remove the object with dental floss and we strongly recommend not to try and remove the object with a sharp or pointed instrument. If you are not successful, contact our office.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toothache that forces you to take pain medication (ibuprofen or tylenol) every four hours</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost/broken a temporary or permanent crown or bridge causing irritation.</span></li>\n</ul>',

  //     '<h2>The Importance of Practicing Good Dental Health</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Periodontitis, also called gum disease, is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue and, without treatment, can destroy the bone that supports your teeth. Increasingly, Periodontitis has been identified as cultivating long-term health problems in a number of patients, rendering diseases such as endocarditis, chronic kidney disease, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease or in some cases, adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Periodontitis is common but largely preventable. It\'s usually the result of poor oral hygiene. Brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups can greatly improve your chances of successful treatment for periodontitis and can also reduce your chance of developing it. But that is only if you continue to practice good dental hygiene. Without these practices, you can leave yourself vulnerable to a variety of long term health implications that can seriously hinder your quality of life should you choose to neglect your teeth. To provide insight into these issues, here is a list of the long-term health problems associated with gum disease.</p>\n\n<h2>Gum Disease Linked to Endocarditis</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Endocarditis is a rare, life-threatening inflammation of the lining of the heart muscle and its valves. It is caused by a bacterial infection. In very rare cases, bacteria in the mouth may trigger endocarditis in people at higher risk.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">What causes endocarditis exactly? Well, bacteria found in tooth plaque may multiply and cause gingivitis (gum disease), rendering inflamed (red or swollen) gums which will bleed during manipulation of the gums usually involved during brushing, flossing or other dental procedures. The problem with this is that when the gums bleed, bacteria can enter the bloodstream, infecting other parts of the body. Endocarditis, in particular, is known to affect the inner lining of the heart and the surfaces of its valves. Bacteria stick to these surfaces and creates growths or pockets of bacteria, negatively affecting your quality of life! Whilst Endocarditis is rare, it is a fatal disease that triggers a range of life-threatening complications, such as heart failure and strokes.</p>\n\n<h2>Gum Disease linked to Respiratory Diseases</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Gum disease can extend beyond the realm of tooth and bone decay and in fact cause serious respiratory issues, which in some cases, can result in death!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Consequently, maintaining periodontal health may contribute to a healthy respiratory system. A number of scientific studies have suggested that periodontal disease may increase the risk of respiratory infections, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. These infections, which are caused when bacteria from the upper throat are inhaled into the lower respiratory tract, can be severely debilitating and are one of the leading causes of death in the U.S.</p>\n\n<h2>Gum Disease Linked to Cardiovascular Disease</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Researchers and health experts have also examined the link between gum disease and cardiovascular health. As aforementioned, Gum disease begins when plaque builds up around teeth. Similarly, a different type of plaque made of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in the blood \u2014 can also build up inside arteries, commonly known as atherosclerosis. This plaque is the cause of coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">It is stipulated that people with gum disease have two to three times the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or other serious cardiovascular events. Whilst there is no definitive evidence to suggest that there is a direct connection between gum disease and cardiovascular problems, researchers still suggest it could be an underlying factor. This is because periodontal disease increases the body\u2019s burden of inflammation - which over a prolonged period of time, is a key contributor to many health problems such as atherosclerosis (a disease where plaque builds up in your arteries).</p>\n\n<h2>Periodontal Disease Linked to adverse Pregnancy Outcomes</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Another major problem associated with unhealthy gums is the adverse pregnancy outcomes they can cause. Several studies have investigated the occurrence of periodontal disease during pregnancy, yielding a wide variation in prevalence. Pregnant women with periodontal disease have been reported to be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight! Again, whilst the evidence is not fully conclusive, there is a compelling trend to suggest that poor dental hygiene resulting in periodontal disease can affect the quality of a newborn\'s life in one way or another.</p>\n\n<h2>How do we prevent these dangerous diseases from occurring?</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Simply, you must brush and floss your teeth regularly as well as attending routine check-ups at the dentist to safeguard yourself from dangerous diseases. Whilst forgetting to maintain good dental hygiene may not seem like a pivotal part of your everyday life short-term, the consequences, in some cases, could be deadly!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">At our family dental practice, we can provide quality dental care to your whole family.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages of our family dental care include:</h2>\n<h3>Convenience</h3>\n\u2013 We are happy to schedule appointments for multiple family members on the same day, to reduce travel and missed time from work or school.\n<h3>Vigilance</h3>\n\u2013 When we treat your entire family, we develop a deep understanding of lifestyle and hereditary conditions that may impact oral health. This helps us intercept problems early, when they are most reversible, and treatment is efficient and economical. We also keep a watchful eye on the oral development of children for possible need of orthodontic intervention.\n<h3>Safety</h3>\n\u2013 By building trusting relationships with families, we know your medical background \u2013 what health issues you may be managing and what medications you take. Should you have a dental emergency, you can count on prompt care with this higher level of assurance.\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">At Procopio Towle Dental Office, you can rest assured knowing your oral health is monitored to safeguard you from costly procedures in the long-run should you neglect your teeth. Call today for your routine check-ups and bring the whole family along. You will not regret it!</p>',

  //     '<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Are you missing a tooth? Or do you have problems with your existing dental restorations? Well the chances are you have questions. To help answer these, we have created a list of the top 5 benefits associated with Dental Implants that will provide you with insight into what they are, how they function and why they are an extremely popular service.</p>\n\n<h2>They Look Natural</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Firstly, one of the main benefits of our dental implants services is their overall naturalistic effect. Dental implants are carefully crafted and designed to look, feel and function like your natural teeth, thus alleviating the many problems associated with the likes of dental dentures, which usually render sore and swelling gums.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Besides the physical benefits analogous with naturalistic teeth, they also positively affect your mental well-being as well. Implants that rectify missing gaps in your teeth enable patients to have the confidence to smile, eat and engage in social activities without being self-conscious about how they look or if the teeth will stay properly aligned and in place. We have all heard the horror stories of dentures falling out when eating, entirely creating an awkward moment for you and other diners. Thankfully, this is not a problem associated with Implants.</p>\n\n<h2>Long-lasting And Reliable</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Following on from the previous point, with delicate maintenance and care, implants have a durable, long-lasting lifespan. Implants last as long as conventional restorations on teeth, with predictable outcomes. So for instance, biting into an apple, taco shell, or even a piece of chicken will ensure the implant stays firmly in place and will not rock back and forth like false teeth. While this may not sound like too big of a deal, the outcome is actually fairly severe for the rest of the teeth in the mouth - cultivating cracked enamel on teeth and painful lacerations on the cheeks, gums or tongue. Again, implants safeguard you from these unfortunate epilogues.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">The best part? With a longer lifespan than other dental services, they can be regarded as a terrific investment in long term oral health - with mental and social benefits too!</p>\n\n<h2>High Success Rate</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">With regular maintenance and care for your implants, these dental procedures can present you with high survival rates. Since they came to fruition in 1970, and now part of day-to-day dental practice, technological developments and techniques have facilitated an increased success rate of implants, particularly in comparison to other teeth replacement options. So, keeping on top of cleaning, flossing and all things implant-maintenance means you will have the best chance for successful, well-functioning dental implants.</p>\n\n<h2>Improved Ability To Eat And Chew</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Sometimes the difficulty with losing a tooth and wearing dentures is that you have to modify what you eat. Meats or sticky foods are a no go with dentures (these include taffy, caramel, marshmallows, peanut butter and raisins). This is primarily due to their ability to affect the fundamental chewing teeth - the upper and lower molars - which consequently dislodge dentures.&nbsp; With Dental Implants there is no need to fear about changing your dietary requirements, as once these dental implants are stable, you can drink and eat as usual (even the sugary stuff in moderation).</p>\n\n<h2>Dental Implants Can Improve facial And Bone Features</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Maintaining your natural bone is one of the most important advantages of dental implants. With missing teeth, the bone begins to resorb over time. Significant bone loss can shrink the contours of the jawbone, causing wrinkled lips and a sunken mouth and chin.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">How dental implants function is by preserving the natural tooth tissues by avoiding the need to cut down adjacent teeth for conventional bridgework. Consequently, by placing a dental implant in your jaw bone, this energizes new bone growth through a process called osseointegration; conserving future bone loss. By ensuring that your jawbones are firmly intact - your facial structure will be sufficiently supported!</p>\n\n<h2>Why Are Dental Implants Beneficial For Me?</h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Dental implants provide a wide array of benefits for patients, which enable them to smile, eat and act normal without having to worry about the functionality of the tooth. These dental procedures can also prevent the onset of extreme side-effects associated with missing teeth such as bone loss and the deconstruction of your face!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">Dental implants are a cost-effective solution to improved dental care and hygiene, particularly in comparison to other restorations that may need extensive maintenance by a dentist on a regular basis. With dental implants, once they are orally fitted and successfully placed, you are good to go. They are also easy to clean and care for, requiring just frequent brushing, dental check-ups and routine hygienist appointments as you would expect with natural teeth.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">So, to create a confident smile, call our practice today or visit our <a href="https://pwdds.com/dental-implants/">dental implants section</a> online to find out all about our services and prices for your very own dental implant.</p>',

  //     '<h2>What is preventative dentistry?</h2>\n<p>Preventive dentistry refers to the process of maintaining good oral health via a combination of regular dental check-ups coincided with frequent brushing and flossing. These preventative steps start early in childhood and extend throughout the course of one\'s life.</p>\n<h3>What are common preventive dentistry services?</h3>\n<p><strong>Preventive dentistry services may include: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular oral exams (usually every 6 months)</li>\n<li>Teeth Cleaning</li>\n<li>Routine X-rays</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What\u2019s your role in preventive dental care?</h2>\n<p>Preventive dental care starts directly with you. Acquiring healthy habits early in life can help reduce cavities, gum disease and gingivitis. Basic procedures in order to maintain good oral health:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brush teeth regularly - at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste</li>\n<li>Floss daily to remove food particles in tight crevices in the teeth which may turn into plaque</li>\n<li>Use a mouthwash to rinse out food particles after flossing.</li>\n<li>Refrain from drinking and eating acidic solutions which can affect tooth enamel and subsequently cause decay</li>\n<li>Be cautious with hard foods which may damage or chip teeth</li>\n<li>Avoid smoking as it can produce bacterial plague, which cultivates the onset of gum disease.</li>\n<li>Mouth guards should be utilised during sporting activities and during nighttime if you are renowned for teeth grinding</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the benefits of preventive dentistry?</h2>\n<p><strong>Lowers your risk of developing tooth decay, gum disease, gingivitis and periodontitis </strong></p>\n<p>With preventive dentistry, dentists can examine your smile every six months during routine dental check ups. Once assessing your teeth, gums and jaw joints, dentists can screen your smile to check for signs of oral cancer and periodontal disease. Preventive methods can then be put in place if they identify any indicators of concern, often in the earliest stages before you experience serious discomfort.</p>\n<p>Indeed, when you avoid the onset of tooth decay and gum disease, the risk of losing those teeth decreases incrementently. Routine cleanings also facilitate the brightening of your teeth, which ultimately protects your smile from discolouration.</p>\n<p><strong>Helps promote good oral hygiene habits such as brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing</strong></p>\n<p>Participating in preventive dentistry can strengthen your smile\u2019s natural defences. When attending routine check-ups, dentists can provide fluoride treatment in addition to extensive tooth cleaning; both of which has the ability to remove all plaque and tartar from the teeth, safeguarding them from developing cavities, gingivitis and tooth-decay. The dental team will show you the most effective ways to brush, and how to clean in between your teeth utilising inter dental brushes or floss to remove the bacterial plaque - promoting good oral hygiene habits.</p>\n<p><strong>Early identification of dental problems may help minimise treatment and cost</strong></p>\n<p>If preventive programs are started early by the patient (or, preferably, by the parents of young children) long-range freedom from the plaque diseases is a possible sound cost-benefit investment. Indeed, over time the costs associated with poor oral hygiene can rapidly increase. Preventive dentistry may not completely eliminate your need for fillings, root canals or dental implants, but it can go a long way to reducing your need for these costly treatments. Thus, for the patient who thinks in terms of economic benefits and enjoyment of life, prevention pays.</p>\n<p><strong>Provides Overall Health Benefits </strong></p>\n<p>Considering that oral health is linked to overall health, preventive dentistry is important for your overall well being. Oral diseases can interfere with eating, speaking, daily activities and self-esteem. In children, severe decay can affect growth and development. Preventive dentistry can result in less extensive \u2013 and less expensive \u2013 treatment for any dental conditions that may develop, and help you keep your natural teeth for a lifetime. Moreover, the absence of teeth or presence of broken-down teeth often results in a loss of self-esteem, minimizes employment possibilities and often curtails social interaction, all of which can be combated by partaking in preventive dentistry.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To find out more about Preventive Dentistry, <a href="https://pwdds.com/contact">Contact</a>\u00a0your Dentist in Walnut Creek, Dr. Tiziana Procopio Towle, DDS at\u00a0<a href="https://pwdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Procopio Towle Dental Office</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',
